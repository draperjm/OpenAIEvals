Pull request 583 adds a new evaluation method called "swedish-spelling" to test the model's ability to identify misspellings in the Swedish language. The evaluation consists of 58 commonly misspelled Swedish words and 58 correctly spelled Swedish words that are usually hard to spell. The evaluation is in the form of a prompt where the model is asked to identify whether a given word is correctly spelled in Swedish or not, and the expected answer is either "Yes" or "No".
