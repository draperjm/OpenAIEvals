The pull request proposes adding a new evaluation method called "Stock Options" to assess GPT-4's ability to assist investors in assessing their portfolio and identifying ideal stock prices based on current holdings. The evaluation includes basic spread examples for derivative trading, such as break-even values, intentions, and terminology. The evaluation consists of five input-output pairs in JSON format, where the input provides a scenario for a derivatives investor, and the output is the ideal breakeven stock price for that scenario. The purpose of this evaluation is to generate a larger set of data to help improve the performance of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 in this domain.
