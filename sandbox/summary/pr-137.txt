Pull request 137 proposes a new evaluation method called `lat_long_identify` that tests the model's ability to match latitude and longitude coordinates to the country they are located in, with the added twist that the model's response must be in the official language of the country. This evaluation has two parts: (1) identifying the country based on the provided coordinates, and (2) identifying the most commonly used language for written communication based on the identified country. The evaluation data consists of 150 samples, and the accuracy of GPT-3.5-Turbo on this evaluation is 0.34%, while GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 0.78%. The evaluation is considered useful because it tests geographical, cultural, and multilingual knowledge. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format.
