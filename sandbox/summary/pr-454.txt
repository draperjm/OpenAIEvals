Pull request 454 proposes an evaluation method called "Taxes Eval" that tests the model's ability to evaluate tax liability for generic examples from common cities including NYC, SF, and Seattle. The evaluation also tests the ordering of multiple-choice options, with the model outputting different results if the multiple-choice labels are switched around. The evaluation consists of presenting the model with tax calculations and four options A through D, and the model's role is to calculate the tax liability and select the option that is closest to its calculation. The evaluation includes five examples with different income levels and cities, and the ideal answer is provided for each example.
