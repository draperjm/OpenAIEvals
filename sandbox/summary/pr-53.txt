Pull request 53 proposes an evaluation method called "formal_logic" to test GPT-3.5-Turbo's ability to evaluate expressions in formal logic, including AND, OR, and NOT with up to 4 leaves. The evaluation contains every leaf-size 4 boolean logic expression using AND, OR, and NOT, generated in Wolfram Language. The evaluation includes JSON data with logical expressions and their expected true/false values. The evaluation is useful to test the model's formal mathematical abilities and its more abstract reasoning abilities.
