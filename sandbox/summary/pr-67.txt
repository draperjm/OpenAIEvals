Pull request 67 proposes an evaluation method called "Imperial-Date-To-String" that tests the ability of GPT models to rewrite dates from mm-dd-yyyy format to human-readable sentences. The evaluation includes dates from the past 100 years and provides JSON data with input and ideal output examples. The method is considered useful as it is a task that current GPT models, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, sometimes struggle with.
