Pull request 272 proposes a new evaluation method called "actors-sequence" that models the sequence of interactions between multiple actors. The evaluation involves short interactions between Merlin, Arthur, and Lancelot, where Merlin outputs short tests, Arthur outputs the sum of the last two digits he had seen, and Lancelot outputs an increasing integer number starting from 0. The sequence in which the actors act is MAMA, and the correct output is given in a specific syntax. The evaluation tests tokenization, the ability to follow a sequence, and termination, and both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 get 7.5% accuracy, indicating issues with tokenization and sequence following. The evaluation is useful in real-life scenarios where basic sequence following and interplay of multiple actors are important.
