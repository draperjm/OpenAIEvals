The evaluation method described in pull request 223 is called "number-pattern". It involves providing a sequence of numbers with one blank and four options as possible answers, and the task is to learn the pattern of the sequence and fill in the blank. The evaluation data consists of several examples with the input sequence and the correct answer. The evaluation is useful because GPT-3 has low accuracy for this task, and it is expected that GPT-4 may also struggle with it.
