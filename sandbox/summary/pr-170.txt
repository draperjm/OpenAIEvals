Pull request 170 proposes the addition of a new evaluation method called "map-electronic-component-part-to-fact". This evaluation method asks technical questions about electronic components, with answers found in PDF files on the open web. The questions are designed to test the ability of the GPT-3.5-Turbo model to extract information from non-trivial representations within the training set. The evaluation consists of several questions, each requiring a single numerical answer rounded to one significant figure. Good performance on this evaluation would be a requirement for building a tool to automatically suggest alternative parts for an application.
