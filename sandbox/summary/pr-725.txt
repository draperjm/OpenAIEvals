Pull request 725 proposes an evaluation method called "tempo_to_measure_count" that tests the model's ability to calculate the number of measures in a song based on the tempo of each note and the corresponding time signature of the piece. This evaluation is useful for assessing the AI model's understanding of music theory, enhancing music composition assistance, improving AI-driven music applications, and facilitating learning and education. The evaluation can easily generate large amounts of data and can be adapted to increase complexity/variables of the prompt as the model is tuned to achieve the goal. The evaluation includes five JSON samples that test the model's ability to answer questions about the number of measures in a song given the tempo and time signature.
