The pull request describes a new evaluation method called "Japanese Oogiri Humor Eval" that asks a model to write a Japanese joke on a subject and evaluates if the text is funny on a scale of 1-5. The evaluation is the first non-English example and uses GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to detect if the jokes are bad, making it a useful model-graded eval. The evaluation data includes prompts in Japanese for the model to generate jokes.
