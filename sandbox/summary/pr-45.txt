The evaluation method described in pull request 45 involves prompting GPT with the FEN of a chess board position and using Stockfish to determine the best move as the ground truth. The evaluation is considered useful because GPT has been known to perform poorly in playing chess. The evaluation includes three examples with FEN notation and possible moves, and the ideal move is identified with a letter. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format.
