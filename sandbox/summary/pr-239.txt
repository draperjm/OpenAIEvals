The pull request describes an evaluation method called "Chess Piece Count" that tests the model's ability to count the number of pieces remaining on a chess board after a set of moves have been played. The evaluation uses input in a PGN format and contains tournament games of varying lengths and levels of play. The evaluation is considered useful because the ability to calculate the game state by following game rules and performing a sequence of steps is important for the model to be able to teach and evaluate games. The evaluation gave a 0.12 accuracy score on GPT-3.5-Turbo and is unique because it was tested on Bing chatbot, which was able to play the game correctly but failed to count the number of pieces on the board correctly. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format.
