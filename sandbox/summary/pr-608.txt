Pull request 608 introduces a new evaluation method for GPT-3.5-Turbo in Brazilian Portuguese. The evaluation focuses on the model's ability to recognize less frequent words in the language. The dataset used for evaluation was created by combining two reliable datasets within the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) corpus, filtering out any words containing special characters or underscores, and obtaining a list of 37,870 valid Brazilian Portuguese words. The evaluation consists of a prompt with a single word, and the user must answer with exactly one letter (Y or N) indicating whether the word exists in the Brazilian language. The evaluation is unique because it addresses a specific aspect of the language and provides a diverse and extensive range of less frequent words to test the model's performance.
