Pull request 157 describes an evaluation method called Rucola, which involves classifying sentences in two categories: acceptable vs generation hallucination. The evaluation uses a slice of the Rucola dataset and is designed to explicitly check for hallucinations. The evaluation is useful because most evaluation tasks are in English, and this provides a multilingual task. The evaluation JSON data includes input and ideal pairs, where the input is a system prompt asking if the sentence is acceptable or a result of language model hallucination, and the user response is either "Acceptable" or "Hallucination".
