Pull request 470 describes the LogiQA dataset, which is a multi-choice machine reading dataset collected from logical reasoning exams. The dataset is challenging for large language models like GPT-3, and fine-tuning methods perform even worse. The dataset is used as an important benchmark for logical reasoning, and for OpenAI Eval, 1572 instances from the test set were transformed into an instruct-prompt scheme. The evaluation method involves presenting a passage and a question with four options to choose from, and the ideal answer is provided. The JSON data includes examples of passages, questions, and options with their corresponding ideal answers.
