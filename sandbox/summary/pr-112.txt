Pull request 112 introduces a new evaluation method called "Born First" that tests the model's ability to determine which of two famous public figures was born first. The evaluation uses U.S. presidents with birthdays within 8 years of each other, and the model achieves only 63% accuracy on this dataset, which is not significantly above chance. The evaluation includes JSON data with input prompts and expected outputs.
