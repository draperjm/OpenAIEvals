## Title: Basic Music Theory: Tempo + Time Signature to Measure Count Eval

## Body:

### Eval name

tempo_to_measure_count

### Eval description

The eval tests the model's ability to calculate the number of measures in a song, based on the tempo of each note and
the corresponding time signature of the piece.

### What makes this a useful eval?

- Assessing the AI model's understanding of music theory: This evaluation would help determine if the model has a solid
  grasp of basic music theory concepts such as note durations, time signatures, and measures.


- Enhancing music composition assistance: A model proficient in calculating measures can be valuable for musicians,
  composers, or music educators, as it can provide quick and accurate assistance in various music-related tasks. This
  test is just a base for more complex usage given the model is able to complete it successfully


- Improving AI-driven music applications: A well-performing model in this evaluation could contribute to the development
  of AI-driven music software, apps, or tools that provide real-time feedback or analysis on a composition's structure,
  allowing for more accurate and efficient results.


- Facilitating learning and education: A model capable of accurately determining measures in a given song can serve as a
  valuable resource for music students and educators, assisting in teaching and learning processes by providing quick
  and accurate insights into a composition's structure.

### Unique eval value

If approved this is a good direction - can easily generate large amounts of data for this eval. It is also easy to adapt
the generation of samples to increase complexity/variables of the prompt as the model is tuned to achieve the goal. It
would be easy to create many more evals in a similar theme.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their
contribution here:
