Title: Utility charge eval
Body:

### Eval name

Utility charge eval

### Eval description

Given snippets from an electric utility bill, compute the per-kWh price for electricity supply and delivery.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Utility bill parsing is needed to understand the breakdown of charges and forecast future bills based on predicted
usage. However, electricity bills can be complex, with dozens of different line items that contribute to the overall
cost. This can be a headache for people looking at their bill, as they just want to understand the per-kWh prices for
the supply/generation or delivery (e.g. transmission & distribution) of their energy. Given incomplete but sufficient
information (e.g. simulating running OCR on a utility bill), this task requires both the understanding and grouping of
different terms and charges under the delivery or supply, and basic arithmetic to compute the total kWh and total
charges in order to determine the per-kWh prices. A human could fairly easily interpret the given data, but we find that
GPT3.5 (as well as GPT4 via the ChatGPT Plus) perform much less accurately on the task (~.2).

### Unique eval value

All of the examples contain dummy values, but come from terminology/formatting used in bills from many different
utilities.

### Eval JSON data

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their
contribution here:
