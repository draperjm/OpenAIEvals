Title: Color Lightness Conversion (HEX to RGB to HSL)
Body:

### Eval name

`convert-hex-hsl-lightness`

### Eval description

This eval aims to evaluate a model's ability to convert a color (provided in hex format) into HSL format and extract the
lightness (L) value as an integer percentage.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is useful as it tests a multi-stage process (convert from hex to RGB, RGB to HSL, extract L as a percentage)
and an understanding of color, color perception, and methods for manipulating color representations. The formulas used
to do so are standard and invariant, so there's a known answer to each eval data prompt.

Being able to parse and understand color is crucial to many design applications. Our original explorations during the
GPT-3 research phase in 2020 showed promise (https://twitter.com/hturan/status/1282381985642614790), and having a
reliable way to understand and manipulate color would be wonderful.
