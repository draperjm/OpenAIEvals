Title: Determinant calculation
Body:

### Eval name

determinant

### Eval description

Asks GPT only the answer of the determinant from 1x1 to 4x4 matrices.

### What makes this a useful eval?

ChatGPT currently has 0% accuracy for determinant calculations. Matrices and determinants are important for a variety of
fields, such as linear algebra, calculus, analysis, algorithms, physics, engineering, etc.

### Unique eval value

In total, I created 400 samples. There are 100 samples for each matrix size, for which there are 20 samples for values
between -10 and 10, 20 samples for values between -100 and 100, until values between -100.000 to 100.000 with the
purpose of creating more diversity and randomness in the values.
