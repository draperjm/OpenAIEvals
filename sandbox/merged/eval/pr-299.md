## Title: Add evaluation of poker hand ranks

## Body:

### Eval name

Poker_hand_ranks

### Eval description

Given two hole cards and five community cards, the goal is to determine the highest rank of hand (from straight flush to
high card) that can be formed with the given cards, following the rules of Texas Hold'em Poker.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The task is useful for evaluating a model's capacity to follow the rules of the game of poker. The capacity to identify
hands of different ranks is a basic skill in poker and can be learned fairly simply by a human player. However,
GPT-3.5-Turbo fails to perform this task consistently, generating the correct response approximately 45% of the time,
even after multiple iterations and improvements from prompt engineering efforts. The simplicity of the data needed for
the task also enabled the generation of a synthetic dataset of poker hands and respective ranks, allowing for robust
experimentation.

### Unique eval value

Since the data used can be generated algorithmically, a reasonably large number of samples (3000) are provided, with the
capacity to scale further for future evaluations. The large and diverse dataset also permits evaluating multiple
failure modes.
