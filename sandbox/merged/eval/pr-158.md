## Title: Add Cube packing eval (Accuracy: 0.02 with 109 tests, yet very easy for humans)

## Body:

### Eval name

cube-pack

### Eval description

This evaluation tests the physical reasoning of GPT by asking how many solid cubes can be fit into a larger box. The
problems are designed to be very easy, so that a human can easily perform the task with 100% accuracy.

### What makes this a useful eval?

ChatGPT 3.5 massively struggles with basic physical reasoning, and especially when it comes to packing objects into, for
example, a box. It seems to give almost completely random answers when trying to understand how many of one object fits
into another.

For example, when asked 'How many solid cubes with dimensions 0.9 m (length) x 0.6 m (width) x 0.9 m (height) can fit in
a box with dimensions 1.1 m (length) x 0.7 m (width) x 1.5 m (height)?' GPT-3.5-Turbo responds 4, when to a human it is
clear only 1 would be able to fit.

This eval is an extremely simple case using cubes into box with the cubes only being slightly smaller than the box. A
human can easily do this 100% of the time, but gpt-3.5-turbo has almost 0% accuracy. In the case GPT 4.0 performs much
better, the test can be made more challenging; of course, it is easy on purpose for now; however, from my experiments with
the GPT4 interface, it seems quite bad as well.

### Unique eval value

The eval has an exact answer, it is a task that is easy for a human, and it is clearly aligned with the reasoning of the
physical world.
