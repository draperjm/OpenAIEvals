Title: Taxes Eval
Body:

### Eval name

Taxes Eval

### Eval description

Tests the model's ability to evaluate tax liability for generic examples from common cities including NYC, SF, and
Seattle. The eval also tests ordering of multiple choice options, with the model outputting different results if the
multiple choice labels are switched around.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Taxes are a relatively logically straightforward task, yet there is a high degree of complexity to the legal and tax
system, which makes calculations difficult to estimate.
