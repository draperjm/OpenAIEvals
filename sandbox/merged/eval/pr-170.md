## Title: Add map-electronic-component-part-to-fact evals

## Body:

### Eval name

map-electronic-component-part-to-fact

### Eval description

This eval asks specific technical questions about electronic components. Answers can be found in PDF files on the open
web, which are likely part of the training data.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Lots of data in the training set is in hard to understand forms. This asks questions about relatively obscure PDF files
that are older than 2021. The PDF files are scattered all over the open web, and consist of datasheets for electronic
components. The information to answer the question is often within a table or diagram. Multiple parts of the document
may need to be understood to find the correct answer.

Good performance on this eval shows that information can be extracted from non-trivial representations within the
training set.

This also has a real world use case: Good performance on this eval would be a requirement to build a tool to
automatically suggest alternative parts for an application.
