## Title: Add Born First Eval

## Body:

### Eval name

Born First

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to determine who was born first.

### What makes this a useful eval?

The model should be able to factually determine which of two famous public figures were born first.

In this eval we use U.S. presidents with birthdays within 8 years of each other. The model only achieves 63% accuracy on
this dataset, which is not significantly above chance. Performance appears to be worse the closer their birthdays.

In many cases, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 appear to know their correct birthdays, but cannot correctly compare them in a
zero-shot manner.
