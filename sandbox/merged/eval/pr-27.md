## Title: Add last-word-nth test

## Body:

### Eval name

last-word-nth

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to tell what the last word of a sentence is, but by asking it indirectly based on its index.

For instance, What is the 7th word in "I saw a cat in the garden"?

Expected:garden

(edit: note that the actual jsonl file includes additional instructions to prevent the models from adding additional
explanations or quote marks to its output)

### What makes this a useful eval?

GPT models are known for having a hard time with those sorts of indexing tasks, so it makes sense to evaluate progress
on
this front.
