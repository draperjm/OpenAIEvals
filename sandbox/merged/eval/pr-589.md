Title: Add emotional intelligence evaluation
Body:

### Eval name

Emotional Intelligence

### Eval description

Evaluates GPT's ability to understand and manage emotional situations using modified versions of the well-validated,
public (i.e. license-unrestricted) tests first developed by MacCann & Roberts (2008). Items have actually here been
aggregated across three different scales-- the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the youth
measure.

Keep in mind that there is no expectation that AI models like GPT-4 should be able to process emotions, so applying any
emotional intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These tests can only measure the AI's ability
to understand and analyze emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human sense.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations,
which is an important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By evaluating the model's performance in
this unique domain, we can identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations when it comes to
handling emotional contexts. This is particularly important when considering AI applications that involve interactions
with humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support systems. A better understanding of emotional
intelligence can potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI models and their users.

### Unique eval value

This Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage
emotions, we can gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more human-centric context. Relatedly,
this eval also emphasizes the importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are designed to
interact with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI
models that are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in emotionally charged situations, such as
mental health counseling, crisis management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional Intelligence eval can
serve as a foundation for further research and development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the
way for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human emotions and fostering more effective
communication.

In this test, you will be presented with a few brief details about an emotional situation, and asked to choose from four responses the most effective course of action to manage both the emotions the person is feeling and the problems they face in that situation. Although more than one course of action might be acceptable, you are asked to choose what you think the most effective response for that person in that situation would be. Remember, you are not necessarily choosing what you would do, or the nicest thing to do, but choosing the most effective response for that situation. Select one or more response(s) by returning the one or more corresponding lowercase letter(s) ('a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'), and, if you selected more than one, sorting them, separated by hyphen, in the order that you think best ranks them from most to least effective, within the context of the vignette provided."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Lee's workmate fails to deliver an important piece of information on time, causing Lee to fall behind schedule also.
