  {"input":[{"role":"system","content":"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about United States tort law."},{"role":"user","content":"A prominent fitness center offers long-term gym memberships that include access to all facilities, personal training sessions, and group classes in exchange for advance payment. State law permits purchasers of such memberships to cancel at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 10% of the membership price. A former manager of the fitness center, who knew about the state law limitations, recently opened a new gym nearby. To attract customers, the former manager sent flyers to local residents stating that anyone who had already purchased a long-term gym membership had \"the right to cancel that membership at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\" The flyer also provided a $50 discount on a long-term membership at the new gym to anyone who canceled an existing membership elsewhere. After the promotion began, several members of the prominent fitness center canceled their memberships and joined the new gym. When the prominent fitness center withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the members objected and threatened to report the matter to the state consumer protection agency. The prominent fitness center has sued the former manager for tortious interference with contract. The former manager has moved for summary judgment, based on the facts mentioned. Should the court grant the motion?\nA. Yes, because the former manager was simply competing with the prominent fitness center.\nB. Yes, because the prominent fitness center's contracts with members were terminable at the members' discretion.\nC. No, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the former manager enticed members to take business away from the prominent fitness center.\nD. No, because the former manager could be found by a jury to have intentionally and improperly interfered with the prominent fitness center's contracts.\nAnswer:"}],"ideal":"C"}

  {"input":[{"role":"system","content":"The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about United States tort law."},{"role":"user","content":"A company operates a brick and stone distribution facility near a residential neighborhood. On the company's property, there is a conveyor belt system with metal sides for loading bricks and stones onto trucks. The trucks being loaded stop on the public road below the conveyor belt. A completely effective method for securing the conveyor belt was available, but the company decided it was not worth the moderate cost. Instead, after closing hours, a wooden barrier was placed on the conveyor belt, and the access ladder was removed to another part of the facility. For several months, however, a group of children, aged eight to 10, had been playing on the company's property and the nearby street after closing hours and had discovered how to use the conveyor belt as a slide. The company was aware of this activity. One evening, as children were playing on the conveyor belt, a driver passing by the conveyor belt hit an eight-year-old girl who slid down in front of the car. The driver applied her brakes, but they suddenly failed, and she hit and injured the child. The driver saw the child in time to have avoided hitting her if her brakes had worked properly. Two days earlier, the driver had taken her car to a mechanic to have her brakes inspected, and the mechanic had told her that the brakes were in perfect condition. Claims were asserted on behalf of the child by her legal representative against the company, the driver, and the mechanic. With respect to the child's claim against the company, will the child prevail?\nA. Yes, because the company could have effectively secured the conveyor belt at a reasonable cost.\nB. Yes, because the company is strictly liable for harm resulting from an artificial condition on its property.\nC. No, because the child was a trespasser.\nD. No, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the injury.\nAnswer:"}],"ideal":"A"}

The next time I see you around here, I'll punch you.\" Two days later, while in the neighborhood, the man saw the plumber approaching him. As the plumber came up to the man, the plumber raised his hand. Thinking he was the real estate agent and reasonably fearing bodily harm, the man struck the plumber. If the plumber asserts a claim against the man and the man relies on the privilege of self-defense, will the man prevail?\nA. No, because the plumber was not an aggressor.\nB. No, because the plumber did not intend his gesture as a threat.\nC. Yes, because the man honestly believed that the plumber would attack him.\nD. Yes, because a reasonable person under the circumstances would have believed that the plumber would attack him.\nAnswer:"}],"ideal":"D"}

In an action against the defendant, can the backup singer recover for his loss of income attributable to the accident?\nA.
