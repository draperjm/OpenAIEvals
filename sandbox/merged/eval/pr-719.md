### Eval name

Answering Japanese Driving License Questions

### Eval description

This eval tests the models ability to correctly answer about Japanse driving license questions, Y or N. The dataset is
created based on the Q&A which is published for students to prepare for the real exam by Japanese driving school. You
can see and try to answer these questions at this site. (<http://drive.kiox.jp/>)

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval can assess the model ability to correctly answer Japanese driving license questions. It's really hard, even
for Japanese students, to understand what the questions mean because of its high-context sentences. (including a lot of
ambiguous meanings in short sentences.)

In pactice, gpt-3.5-turbo could correctly answer only 26 questions out of 60 (43.333333333333335%).

So, this eval helps gpt model understand Japanese difficult context and acquire more knowledge of Japanese
transportation.
