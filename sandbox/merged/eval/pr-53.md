Title: Formal Logic
Body:

### Eval name

formal_logic

### Eval description

Test the model's ability to evaluate expressions in formal logic. Includes expressions using, AND, OR, and NOT with up
to 4 leaves.

### What makes this a useful eval?

One of GPT-3.5's (and GPT-4's) worst performing subjects is math. Formal logic tests both the model's formal
mathematical abilities and its more abstract reasoning abilities.

### Unique eval value

This eval contains every leaf-size 4 boolean logic expression using AND, OR and NOT. (Removing some cases of
triple-NOTs, etc.) Everything was generated in Wolfram Language.
