## Title: add lat-long-identify eval

## Body:

### Eval name

`lat_long_identify`

### Eval description

This eval tests the model's ability to correctly match latitude and longitude coordinates to the country they are
located in. The twist is that the model's response must be in the official language of the country.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a two-fold evaluation that (1) evaluates the model's ability to correctly identify the country based on the
provided latitude-longitude coordinates, and (2) evaluates the model's ability to identify the most commonly used
language for written communication based on the identified country.

GPT-3.5 gets 0.34% accuracy on the standard match evaluation scheme, while GPT-4 gets 0.78% accuracy, which still
uncovers some multilingual issues in its ability to solve the task. I think it might be worth including this task that
tests geographical, cultural and multilingual knowledge.
