## Title: Add brazilian-lexicon eval

## Body:

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval is useful because it focuses on the model's ability to recognize less frequent words in Brazilian Portuguese,
which is essential for understanding the nuances of the language. By testing the model on this dataset, we can evaluate
how well it grasps less frequent words and improve its overall understanding of Brazilian Portuguese.

### Unique eval value

This eval is unique because it addresses a specific aspect of the Brazilian Portuguese language: less frequent words. By
focusing on these words, we can test the model's ability to recognize and understand the nuances of the language. This
will help improve the model's overall performance in Brazilian Portuguese and ensure it is capable of handling a wide
range of language complexities.

The dataset was carefully created by following these steps:

- We started with a list of less frequent words in Brazilian Portuguese, which were sourced from two reliable datasets
  within the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) corpus: "machado" and "floresta". "Machado" contains the works of Brazilian
  writer Machado de Assis, while "floresta" is a corpus of Portuguese texts annotated with linguistic information.


- We combined the words from both corpora and calculated their frequency, focusing on less frequent words.


- To ensure the quality of the dataset, we filtered out any words containing special characters or underscores, as these
  are not typically present in valid Brazilian Portuguese words.


- After filtering, we obtained a list called "filtered_less_frequent_words" containing 37,870 valid Brazilian Portuguese
  words.


- This comprehensive list of words was then used as the basis for the eval, providing a wide variety of less frequent
  words to test the model's performance in recognizing and understanding these words in the Brazilian Portuguese
  language.

By creating the dataset in this way, we ensured that it contains a diverse and extensive range of less frequent words,
making the eval a unique and valuable tool for assessing the model's ability to recognize and understand less frequent
words in Brazilian Portuguese. By using the "machado" and "floresta" corpora, the dataset also benefits from being
rooted in authentic Brazilian Portuguese texts, further enhancing its relevance and value.
