Title: LogiQA: A Challenge Dataset for Machine Reading Comprehension with Logical Reasoning Instruct-Prompt Version For
OpenAI EVAL
Body:

### Eval name

[LogiQA]

### Eval description

[LogiQA is a multi-choice machine reading dataset released in 2020, and in 2023 we updated the dataset to version 2. The dataset is collected from Logical reasoning exams with excellent annotation quality. Our experiments showed that it is challenging even for Large Language Models like GPT-3. Fine-tuning methods perform even worse. Up to now, the SOTA score on the dataset is 55% accuracy. The dataset is used by many researchers in their probing tasks and is an important benchmark for logical reasoning. For this OpeanAI Eval, we transformed 1572 instances from the test set into an instruct-prompt scheme.]

### What makes this a useful eval?

[Logical reasoning ability is a fascinating topic in the NLP community. We hope to see if GPT4 sheds more light on this topic.]

The fungus that causes the disease can be controlled with fungicides, but the fungicides can pose a health hazard to people living nearby. The fungicides are thus unsuitable for small banana groves in populated areas. Fortunately, most large banana plantations are in locations so isolated that fungicides can be used safely there. Therefore, most of the world' s banana crop is not seriously threatened by Sigatoka disease."}, {"role": "system", "content": "Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 1: Sigatoka disease is the only disease that threatens bananas on a worldwide scale."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 2: Most of the banana trees that have not been exposed to the Sigatoka fungus grow in small banana groves."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 3: Large plantations produce most or all of the world's bananas."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 4: Sigatoka disease is the only disease that threatens bananas on a worldwide scale."}], "ideal": "3"}

Yet in a recent study, of 1, 000 people who suspected that they had swimmer' s ear, 84 percent had made a correct diagnosis -- a slightly better accuracy rate than physicians have in diagnosing swimmer' s ear. Thus, clearly, most people can diagnose swimmer' s ear in themselves without ever having to consult a physician."}, {"role": "system", "content": "Question: Which one of the following, if true, most undermines the conclusion?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 1: Cases in which swimmer's ear progresses to more serious infections are very rare."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 2: For many people who develop swimmer's ear, the condition disappears without medical or pharmaceutical intervention."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 3: Physicians who specialize in ear diseases are generally able to provide more accurate diagnoses than those provided by general practitioners."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Option 4: Cases in which swimmer's ear progresses to more serious infections are very rare."}], "ideal": "4"}
