### Eval name

Heart Disease Prediction

### Eval description

This eval tests the model's ability to correctly predict the probability of a patient to have heart disease. The dataset
is constructed from
the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) on Kaggle.
The data includes the patient's age, sex, and a number of medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease.

The data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL).

### What makes this a useful eval?

This assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical events. Correctly predicting heart disease shows
the model's capability for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo model currently receives an accuracy
of 0.778.

As far as I can tell, this is the only eval so far related to making medical diagnoses. To make sure it was a high-quality eval, I tried to find a dataset with a lot of observations and created by doctors with the relevant expertise.
