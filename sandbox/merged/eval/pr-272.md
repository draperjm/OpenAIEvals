## Title: Adds multiple actor, sequence following, tokenization evaluator

## Body:

# GPT-4 doesn't pay close attention to detail in some cases.

Here's a quick test to show it:

```

This is an exchange between Merlin, Arthur and Lancelot.

- Merlin outputs short tests. First output is: "1+2", second is "3+4", ...

- Arthur outputs the sum of last two digits that he had seen.

- Lancelot outputs an increasing integer number, starting from 0.



Here is the sequence in which the actors act: MAMA. 

Output that exchange using the following syntax exactly (including the trailing comma): Actor:<output>,...

```

Correct output here would be: `Merlin:1+2,Arthur:3,Merlin:3+4,Arthur:7,`. Simple.

A sampled output from GPT-4: `Merlin:1+2,Arthur:3,Lancelot:0,Merlin:3+4,Arthur:7,Lancelot:1,`

Note that:

- MAMA sequence is not followed;

- Arthur is summing up numbers, not digits (for longer sequences);

- GPT-4 ignores the length of the sequence.

For this evaluator:

- A human can solve these tasks easily (1 minute) and write down the resulting sequence.

- Tasks are concise and deterministic, formulated in natural language

- 30 tasks are set up by human input, the rest are random

- Tasks only require counting, logic, and single digit arithmetic.

- Both gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 get 7.5% accuracy making many mistakes

- Mistakes are likely caused by issues with tokenization and sequence following.

The functionality is useful in the product/real life settings as basic sequence following and interplay of multiple
actors is of importance to many real life scenarios.

### Eval name

actors-sequence

### Eval description

This evaluates interaction between multiple actors that are following rules of logic. This also evaluates tokenization,
ability to follow a sequence and termination. Short interactions are evaluated (5-10 steps). A human, unfamiliar with
the task, can solve these unassisted in one-two minutes. Extension to longer sequences is possible. The evaluation is
set up in the following way:

```

This is an exchange between Merlin, Arthur and Lancelot.

- Merlin outputs short tests. First output is: "1+2", second is "3+4", ...

- Arthur outputs the sum of last two digits that he had seen.

- Lancelot outputs an increasing integers number, starting from 0.



Here is the sequence in which the actors act: MAMA. Output that exchange using the following syntax exactly (including the trailing comma): Actor:<output>,...

```

### What makes this a useful eval?

This models sequence of interactions between multiple actors. Such interactions are common in real-life products.

### Unique eval value

This eval was designed from scratch, specifically for GPT-4 and is fresh (not in the literature or on the internet).
