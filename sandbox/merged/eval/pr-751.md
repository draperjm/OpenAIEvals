Title: Eval multi step equations
Body:

### Eval name

multi-step-equations

### Eval description

Provides a set of relatively simple algebra equations that require multiple steps to solve. The AI is given a system
message to solve the equation for x answering with only a number. Each eval contains an example math problem and the
correct solution.

### What makes this a useful eval?

I found this issue when comparing the ROI of two savings accounts. One had a fixed rate, and the other had a tiered rate
that was a lower rate up to $5,000 and a higher rate above that amount. I wanted to find the dollar amount at which the
tiered savings account became a better investment. The AI walked me through the logic of the steps correctly. However,
it failed on the basic math. I had to copy the steps into a google sheet in order to figure out what went wrong and get
the correct value. Users are likely to assume the AI is computing the algebra correctly, especially when steps are
written out. I simplified the evals to check only for equations as this type of math would be used in multiple
scenarios.

Interestingly, the AI has a higher success rate you allow it to walk through the steps. However, prompting for just the
answer I have gotten middling results with GPT4 and poor results with GPT 3.5.

### Unique eval value

I hand made these equations and have provided a publicly accessible verification using Wolfram Alpha:

Since we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their
contribution here:
