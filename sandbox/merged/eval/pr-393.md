### Eval name

Escher Sentences

### Eval description

This eval tests the ability of a model to reason about sentences that look normal but are actually incoherent.

For example, "More people have been to Russia than I have." Seems like a normal sentence at first but actually makes no
sense. GPT 3.5 seems terrible at figuring these out while 4 seems to do an adequate job but miss a few. I've
found that GPT 3.5 scores at about 20 %, which is worse than random guessing as all questions are true or false. I've also
added questions of varying difficulty, so it should be noted that GPT 3.5 performs at 0% on some question sets.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Understanding these sentences does not require any specialist knowledge but does require a few moments of consideration
for most humans. It is interesting that LLMs seem to miss how illogical the sentences are even when asked directly if x
sentence is illogical.

I would guess that the ability to perform well on these sentences cannot be consistently fine-tuned or learned by giving
examples in context but instead requires at least a high level of linguistic ability. That is to say that a less capable
model likely can't be shown how to solve these problems. Additionally, to determine that these sentences are illogical
and not just a logical thought with a user typo requires a human to consider what alternative meanings the sentence
could have before concluding that the sentence does not clearly point to any one meaning. This may be a complex process
that requires some level of situational modeling and is only indirectly correlated to performance on logical reasoning
tests and linguistic tests.
