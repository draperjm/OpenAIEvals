Title: Counting bigrams in sentences
Body:

### Eval name

Bigram Counting

### Eval description

Tests whether the model is able to count the frequency of bigrams in a sentence.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This is a basic task for humans, and it's possibly slightly more 'difficult' than counting the occurrences of a
single letter.

Bigram frequencies are used in applications ranging from rudimentary NLP tasks to cryptography.
