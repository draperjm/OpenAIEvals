## Title: Identify the job listing title for a caregiver in Japan

## Body:

### Eval name

Identify the job listing title for a caregiver in Japan.

### Eval description

We assessed the ability to accurately recognize information in the titles of typical Japanese caregiving job listings.

The job titles provided as queries included a mix of information such as job type, qualifications, and employment
status.

The answer choices were given with variations of

- "job type only"

- "job type and qualifications"

- "job type and employment status"

- "job type, qualifications, and employment status"

Note: Reference information on job type, qualifications, and employment status is provided in the prompt.

### What makes this a useful eval?

In order to correctly recognize job titles, it is necessary to have background knowledge about job types,
qualifications, and employment statuses, as well as knowledge of conventional abbreviations and synonyms related to
them, making the task highly challenging. Despite providing reference information in the prompt, the correct answer rate
was 60%.

On the other hand, the benefits of accurately handling job information are significant, as nearly all humans come into
contact with job postings. (Even when limited to Japanese caregiving jobs, millions of people are involved.)

Therefore, this is a challenge worth undertaking, and it is a reason to consider this evaluation useful.
