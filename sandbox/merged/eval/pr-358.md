## Title: Add partially solved crossword clues eval

## Body:

### Eval name

Partially solved crossword clues

### Eval description

This evaluates the model's ability to find the answer to crossword clues, when some of the letters of the answer are
already provided.

### What makes this a useful eval?

GPT-3.5 does really badly on this task and often doesn't respect the required length of the answer or the letters
already provided. I tried some samples on GPT-4, and it seems to do a lot better, but still sometimes fails to respect
the specified letters.
