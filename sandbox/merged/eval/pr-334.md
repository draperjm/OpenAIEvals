Title: [evals] add stock option spread examples
Body:

### Eval name

Stock Options

### Eval description

Covers basic spread examples for derivative trading. Including break even values, intentions, and basic terminology.

### What makes this a useful eval?

As an assistant, GPT-4 should be able to be utilized by an investor to assess their portfolio, reporting on current
sentiment, as well as future sentiment resulting from a trade. GPT-4, while not suggesting trades, should still be able
to identify ideal stock prices for an investor's portfolio based off of current holdings. In addition, GPT-4 should be
aware of basic terminology to better fit in an investors toolset.

GPT3.5-turbo as well as GPT-4 are currently demonstrating underwhelming and unreliable results demonstrating a lack of
data pertaining to the subject. If this sample set is suitable, I can generate a larger set of data to help remedy the
blind spot.
