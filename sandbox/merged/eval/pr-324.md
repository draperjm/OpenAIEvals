Title: [Eval] Complex Replace Characters
Body:

### Eval name

complex-replace-characters

### Eval description

This eval is about complex prompts for character replacement. Each prompt contains multiple instructions.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Character replacements are an easy task for humans, albeit a tedious one. GPT 3.5-turbo gets a score of only 0.06. I
tried most of them (but not all) on GPT-4, and it appears that GPT-4 doesn't score much better. I found that GPT-4,
while much better at it than 3.5, still has difficulty following all instructions completely and accurately. I got the
lowest results when the prompt combined several simple instructions, hence in this eval, I decided to focus on the
particular failure mode where the prompt is complex and contains multiple instructions.

### Unique eval value

I thoroughly tested the accuracy of the "ideal" strings in the samples. I wrote python code (which I will post below)
that verifies their accuracy.

### Eval JSON data

There are 10 different instructions. Below are the simplest examples for each instruction. The file contains more
complex examples.
