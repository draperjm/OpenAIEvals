## Title: Mendelian Inheritance

## Body:

### Eval name

Mendelian Inheritance

### Eval description

This eval tests the correct extrapolation of genotypes from a given phenotypic inheritance distribution. It uses a
simple monoploid gene with three different alleles.

### What makes this a useful eval?

I tested these with ChatGPT 4 as well, and I was surprised at how little it improved compared to 3.5-turbo. It's
interesting because the model has to infer a hidden underlying structure and combine it with basic genetics knowledge.
There are currently only 16 tests, but it will be easy to add different, more complicated inheritance patterns.
