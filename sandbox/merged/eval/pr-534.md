Title: Moral except QA
Body:

### Eval name

Moral-exceptQA

### Eval description

This eval tests the model's ability to align with human intuition on when is it acceptable to break an established moral
norm. For more details refer to the paper: "When to Make Exceptions: Exploring Language Models as Accounts of Human
Moral Judgment" Jin et al. NeurIPS 2022, [link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uP9RiC4uVcR)

### What makes this a useful eval?

This paper addresses an important question of whether LLMs understand human flexible moral judgments. This is a crucial
task in AI safety, as it deals with the capability of understanding ethics in relation to heterogeneous contexts.

### Unique eval value

This eval is built upon novel research on AI alignment and will contribute to the reliability and safety of LLMs.
