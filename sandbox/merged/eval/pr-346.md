Title: [evals] Word from first letters of words in a sentence
Body:

### Eval name

first-letters

### Eval description

Given a sentence, extract the word obtained from concatenating the first letters of its words.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task represents a failure mode for both GPT3.5 and GPT4, while being extremely easy for humans.

Both models tend to do OK with shorter sentences, but fail with a larger number of words.

For humans, however, this task is trivial, regardless of the length of the sentence.

GPT3.5 exhibits another failure mode in which it often fails to follow the precise instruction of using only letters in
its response.

### Unique eval value

The task is highly trivial for humans, yet both GPT4 and GPT3.5 struggle with it.
