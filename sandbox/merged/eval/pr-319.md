Title: Manga Translation Eval
Body:

### Eval name

manga-translation

### Eval description

Testing the model's ability to translate Manga (Japanese comics) from Japanese into English.

### What makes this a useful eval?

We think this is useful primarily because it's a good way to test models on a less standard translation case.
Specifically,

1) The content of the text has a very different domain from most translation tasks

2) Context from surrounding speech bubbles/panels is important, so being able to use them in translation is better, but
   in order to do that, the model needs to make sure the number of output translations precisely matches the number of
   input translations (it seems to struggle with this)

3) The task is fundamentally multi-modal because oftentimes necessary information is contained in the image surrounding
   the text; current evals are text-only, but we really want to try this with GPT-4's image processing capabilities as
   well (and plan to update the eval to include images as soon as such functionality becomes available)

### Unique eval value

Manga translation is a pretty unique task.
