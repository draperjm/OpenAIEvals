Title: Rhyming words in a different language (Hebrew)
Body:

### Eval name

hebrew-rhyme

### Eval description

Given a pair of two words in English, the task is to determine whether their Hebrew translations rhyme and if so, output
the rhyming pair in Hebrew.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This task tests the ability of the model to carry out a composite task that involves reasoning in a different language
than the source language. It is relatively simple for a bilingual human but gpt-3.5-turbo scores about the same as
random guessing.
