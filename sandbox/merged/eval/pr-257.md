### Eval name

Causal Reasoning of Entities and Events in Procedural Texts (__CREPE__)

### Eval description

__CREPE__ is a benchmark for model's causal reasoning. The dataset consists of _procedures_ and _imaginary events_. The
labels are the _change in the likelihood_ of the _imaginary events_ from happening throughout a _procedure_. A
language model is to take the _procedure up to the current step_ and the _imaginary event_ as input and predict the
likelihood that the _event_ happens at the _current step_ comparing to the previous step. The label space is
therefore {"more likely", "less likely", "equally likely"}.

See [[Causal Reasoning About Entities and Events in Procedural Texts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10896.pdf#:~:text=Entities%20and%20events%20are%20crucial%20to%20natural%20lan-guage,combined%20with%20chain-of-thought%20prompt-ing%20for%20multihop%20event%20reasoning.1)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10896.pdf#:~:text=Entities
and events are crucial to natural language, combined with chain-of-thought prompting for multihop event reasoning.1)
for details.

### What makes this a useful eval?

__CREPE__ testifies model's capability of conducting causal reasoning with commonsense knowledge. By construction of the
dataset, the scenarios narrated in the _procedures_ are scenes from our daily life, and the _imaginary events_ are events
that can be reliably answered by humans using commonsense knowledge (human performance = 0.87 F1) but difficult for
machines due to the absence of explicit mentioning of the commonsense knowledge in the text. Therefore, it is a useful
evaluation to (1) GPT-4's causal reasoning capability, (2) GPT-4's commonsense knowledge, and (3) GPT-4's ability to
conduct causal reasoning with commonsense knowledge.
