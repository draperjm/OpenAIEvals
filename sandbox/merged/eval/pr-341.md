## Title: Diagrammatic Reasoning Logic [~35%]

### Diagrammatic Reasoning Logic

### Eval description

This eval is similar to diagrammatic reasoning tests you can find online. I wrote some code to procedurally generate
test questions and have adapted it in order to make it GPT friendly. I am interested to see how GPT performs given an
image prompt of a question instead of the text representation below.

An example problem:

Definition of each operator and what it does:

Operator, Effect

C Changes size and shading of all figures

D Changes shape of all figures

E Changes 1st figure (see examples)

Examples of these operators on some made-up sequences:

Input, Process, Output

| small dark circle | | small dark triangle | - C - | large light circle | | large light triangle |

| small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | small dark triangle | | small dark triangle | - D - | small light
circle | | large dark circle | | small light circle | | small dark circle |

| large dark circle | | large dark triangle | - E - | small dark triangle | | large dark triangle |

Question:

| small dark triangle | | large light circle | | small dark circle | - D - ?

Possible Answers:

A - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large dark triangle |

B - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | small dark triangle |

C - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large light triangle | | small dark triangle |

D - | large dark circle | | large light triangle | | large dark triangle |

Answer:

B

Explanation: The answer is B, this is due to the fact that the operation applied to the original sequence of small dark
triangle, large light circle and small dark circle is D which changes the shape of all the figures. Therefore, the final
result will be small dark circle, large light triangle, small dark triangle where only the shape characteristic for each
figure has changed.

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval tests multiple aspects of General Intelligence. An example is having to infer what an operation is doing
without being told explicitly. GPT also needs to work out how to apply this operation generically instead of considering
just the example sequences. There are harder questions in the dataset that use multiple operators in sequence. It also
tests technical vocabulary and sequence logic. This is a particularly challenging task even for humans and requires
focus.
