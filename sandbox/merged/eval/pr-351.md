Title: [eval] Forth Stack Simulator
Body:

### Eval name

Forth Stack Simulator

### Eval description

Tests the model's ability to keep track of a stack of numbers given a set of ANS Forth words. The model is asked to
respond to a series of numbers and words with the resulting stack representation. The words used in the tests are
arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and stack
operators: `drop`, `swap`, `rot`, `over`, `dup`, `2over`, `2drop`, `2swap`, `2dup`, `nip`. The prompts and expected
results on the stack are all less than 15 numbers and words long.

### What makes this a useful eval?

What makes this useful are the interesting properties of Forths, which are simple machines that operate on a stack of
numbers using words built up from simple primitives. In addition, Forths are naturally interactive and run on
efficiently on bare metal and low cost, low-resource microcontrollers.

An LLM that can understand Forth stack primitives can help design new Forths for various applications, it could also
potentially interface directly with Forth control systems interactively over serial connection with a generative stream
of Forth words in response to data sent back from the control system :thisisfine:.

### Unique eval value

Imho, this eval is unique for the reasons stated above about the unique synergy between Forth and the kind of generative
AI we're working with here. Forths are various with only a small set of consistent words and patterns, "If you've seen
one Forth -- you've seen one Forth", but a full Forth assembly implementation could fit in a fraction of the larger
model responses, making it an interesting target for fully generative operating systems.

Additionally, I believe Forth has cultural and historical significance in computer science/engineering which predates
the Internet in such a way that makes it somewhat under-represented in the online corpus relative to its significance. A
model of all human knowledge should have a strong grasp on how it works.
