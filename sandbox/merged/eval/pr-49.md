## Body:

### Eval name

Connect 4 Winner Identification

### Eval description

The purpose of this eval is to test the model's ability to correctly identify the winner of a finished Connect 4 game
board. The game board is represented by a string e.g. 000000\n...00X00Y0 where "0" represents an empty cell, "X"
represents a cell occupied by player 1, and "Y" represents a cell occupied by player 2.

### What makes this a useful eval?

Connect 4 is a classic board game that requires strategy and logical thinking. The game has a finite number of possible
board states and outcomes, making it an ideal task for evaluating a model's ability to reason and make predictions based
on input data.

### Unique eval value

Connect 4 is a popular and well-known game, this eval can be easily understood and evaluated by humans, making it a
useful tool for evaluating and benchmarking language models.
