## Title: Solve Anagram (16% accuracy)

## Body:

### Eval name

Anagram resolution

### Eval description

Given an anagram (word whose letters have been randomly shuffled), find the original word. The dataset only takes 12+
character long words.

The prompt could include a list of 100+ candidates (the anagram being one of those) which would make the guess easier
for a human being, but oddly enough, the accuracy is lower with this input.

### What makes this a useful eval?

- Mix both logical and semantical skills (find an existing word and test swap letters on the input)

- Task is easy for humans on long words because it has fewer match while chat-gpt struggle on this because there are more
  possible swaps (its perf are much better on short words)

- The task can be automated with a script, specially ChatGPT can output a script to find the solution
