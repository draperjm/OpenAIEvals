## Title: [evals] Basic world knowledge in Mongolian language (~10% accuracy)

## Body:

### Eval name

Basic world concepts and knowledge in Mongolian language

### Eval description

Tests model's ability to answer simple questions in Mongolian language and its latin variant

### What makes this a useful eval?

This eval has several trivial questions regarding basic knowledge of the world, however, they're written in
Mongolian.

GPT-3.5-Turbo shows ability to form answers in Mongolian language, but rarely are its answers correct. Sometimes it shows
it understands the idea of a question but fails to answer factually. Translated examples:

- "How many legs do humans have?" - "Zero"

- "Is fire hot or cold?" - "Cold"

- "Which country borders Mongolia to the south?" - "Russia".

In worse cases, its answers are unrelated, nonsensical or even offensive.

This eval also has prompts in "Latin version" of the Mongolian language. This version isn't official and is used
mostly by Mongolians on social media. The language model when prompted the same question in official Cyrillic and
unofficial Latin version in the same session generally gives the same answers in a respective version.
