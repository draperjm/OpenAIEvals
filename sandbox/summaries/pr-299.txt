Pull request 299 adds an evaluation method for GPT-3.5-Turbo's ability to identify the highest rank of hand that can be formed with two hole cards and five community cards in a game of Texas Hold'em Poker. The evaluation is useful for testing the model's ability to follow the rules of the game and can be learned fairly easily by a human player. The evaluation uses a synthetic dataset of 3000 poker hands and respective ranks, which can be scaled for future evaluations. The dataset also permits evaluating multiple failure modes. The evaluation method includes JSON data with example inputs and ideal outputs.
