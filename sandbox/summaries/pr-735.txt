The evaluation method described in pull request 735 involves computing the per-kWh price for electricity supply and delivery given snippets from an electric utility bill. The task requires understanding and grouping different terms and charges under delivery or supply, and basic arithmetic to compute the total kWh and total charges to determine the per-kWh prices. The evaluation uses JSON data with at least 5 samples from different utilities, and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 perform much less accurately on the task.
