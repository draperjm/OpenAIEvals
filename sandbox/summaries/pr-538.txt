The pull request describes an evaluation method for GPT-3.5-Turbo's ability to predict the probability of a patient having heart disease. The evaluation uses a dataset constructed from the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset on Kaggle, which includes the patient's age, sex, and medical signals relevant to the diagnosis of heart disease. The evaluation involves providing the model with patient descriptions and relevant medical signals and asking it to predict whether the patient is likely to have heart disease (1) or not (0). The evaluation is considered useful as it assesses the model's ability to correctly predict adverse medical events and shows its capability for a strong understanding of medicine. The GPT-3.5-turbo model currently receives an accuracy of 0.778 on this evaluation.
