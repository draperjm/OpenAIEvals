Pull request 372 proposes a new evaluation method called "belarusian-lexicon" to test the ability of GPT models to distinguish between existing and hallucinated Belarusian words. The evaluation contains 150 pairs of single-word prompts, with one item in each pair being a non-word hallucinated by ChatGPT and the other being an actual Belarusian word with similar spelling. The model's task is to distinguish between words and non-words. The evaluation is unique in that it highlights specific deficiencies in the model's ability to handle a lower-resource language like Belarusian and could serve as an instructive example for other language communities. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format.
