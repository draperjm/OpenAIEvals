The pull request describes an evaluation method called "Mendelian Inheritance" that tests the correct extrapolation of genotypes from a given phenotypic inheritance distribution using a simple monoploid gene with three different alleles. The evaluation uses a monohybrid inheritance with three alleles, B, G & T, and tests the model's ability to infer a hidden underlying structure and combine it with basic genetics knowledge. The evaluation includes 16 tests, but it is easy to add different, more complicated inheritance patterns. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format and includes input, user response, and ideal response for each test.
