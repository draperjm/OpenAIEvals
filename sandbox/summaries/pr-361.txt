Pull request 361 describes an evaluation method called ROT13, which tests GPT-4's character-level abilities. The evaluation involves decoding ROT13 strings, which a human with a character lookup table could easily solve. The accuracy of GPT 3.5 Turbo in this evaluation is 0.05. The evaluation includes JSON data with input and ideal outputs for several examples. The evaluation is useful because it tests the model's ability to decode ROT13 strings, even though the results it gives are incorrect.
