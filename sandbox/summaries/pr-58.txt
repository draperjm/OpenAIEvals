The evaluation method described in pull request 58 involves instructing GPT to decrypt a Caesar cipher given a 'shift' integer between 1 and 5, using chunks of up to 100 characters from open literature. The purpose of this evaluation is to test GPT's ability to perform decryption and general string manipulation, which are tasks that language models have traditionally struggled with. The evaluation includes JSON data with input and ideal outputs for several examples of encrypted text.
