Pull request 627 describes an evaluation method called "naughty_strings" that tests the performance of GPT models in identifying potentially malicious input to a system, such as for XSS attacks or SQL injection. The evaluation consists of 400 strings, including 200 from "The Big List of Naughty Strings," 100 color names, and 100 people's names in Brazil. The evaluation results were consistent, with GPT only misclassifying strings that should be considered malicious, while regular strings were properly identified. The pull request also includes JSON data for the evaluation and graded model evaluation.
