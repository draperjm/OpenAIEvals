Pull request 358 introduces a new evaluation method called "Partially solved crossword clues". This evaluation method tests the model's ability to find the answer to crossword clues when some of the letters of the answer are already provided. The evaluation includes several sample inputs and expected outputs in JSON format. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the performance of GPT-3.5 on this task, which it performs poorly on, and to see if GPT-4 performs better.
