Pull request 319 proposes an evaluation method called "manga-translation" to test GPT-3.5-Turbo's ability to translate Japanese comics (Manga) into English. The evaluation is unique because it involves a different domain of translation, requires context from surrounding speech bubbles/panels, and is fundamentally multi-modal. The evaluation JSON data includes a sequence of texts representing some pages of manga in Japanese, and the model is expected to generate a high-quality English translation that accurately conveys the meaning and emotion of the original text. The number of output translations must precisely match the number of input translations.
