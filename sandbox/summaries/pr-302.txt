The evaluation method described in pull request 302 is called "Bigram Counting". It tests whether the model can count the frequency of bigrams in a sentence. The evaluation involves presenting the model with a sentence and asking it to count the frequency of a specific bigram. The evaluation data consists of several examples of sentences with the target bigram and the expected frequency. This evaluation is considered useful because bigram frequencies are used in various applications, including NLP tasks and cryptography.
