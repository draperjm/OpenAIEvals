Pull request 508 adds a Bulgarian lexicon evaluation to test the model's ability to distinguish between existing and hallucinated Bulgarian words. The evaluation contains 680 prompts, including 340 real words sourced from the official Bulgarian Language Institute dictionary and 340 fake words sourced from various sources. The evaluation is unique because it falls in the middle between languages like English and ones like Belarusian. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format.
