The evaluation method described in pull request 338 tests the ability of GPT-3.5-Turbo to answer simple questions in Mongolian language and its unofficial Latin variant. The evaluation includes basic world knowledge questions, but the model's accuracy is only around 10%. The questions are designed to test the model's ability to answer factually, but sometimes its answers are unrelated, nonsensical, or even offensive. The evaluation includes prompts in both official Cyrillic and unofficial Latin versions of Mongolian language, and the model generally gives the same answers in both versions.
