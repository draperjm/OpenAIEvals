The pull request describes an evaluation method called "Forth Stack Simulator" that tests a model's ability to keep track of a stack of numbers given a set of ANS Forth words. The model is asked to respond to a series of numbers and words with the resulting stack representation. The evaluation is unique because Forths are simple machines that operate on a stack of numbers using words built up from simple primitives, and a full Forth assembly implementation could fit in a fraction of the larger model responses, making it an interesting target for fully generative operating systems. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format, with prompts and expected results on the stack being less than 15 numbers and words long.
