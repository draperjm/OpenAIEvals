The pull request proposes an evaluation method called "multi-step-equations" that provides a set of algebra equations that require multiple steps to solve. The AI is given a system message to solve the equation for x answering with only a number. The evaluation contains an example math problem and the correct solution. The unique value of this evaluation is that the equations are hand-made and publicly accessible verified using Wolfram Alpha. The evaluation JSON data contains at least 5 samples of the evaluation.
