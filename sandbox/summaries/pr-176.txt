The evaluation method described in pull request 176 is called "hebrew-rhyme". It involves determining whether a pair of English words have Hebrew translations that rhyme, and if so, outputting the rhyming pair in Hebrew. The purpose of this evaluation is to test the model's ability to reason in a different language than the source language. The evaluation data consists of pairs of English words and their corresponding Hebrew translations, with the expected output being either the rhyming pair in Hebrew or "NONE" if the words do not rhyme.
