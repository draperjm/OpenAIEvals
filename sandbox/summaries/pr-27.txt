Pull request 27 proposes a new evaluation method called "last-word-nth" to test the model's ability to identify the last word of a sentence based on its index. The evaluation involves asking the model to provide the nth word in a sentence, and the expected answer is the last word of the sentence. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the model's ability to handle indexing tasks, which is a known challenge for GPT models. The evaluation includes a JSON data file with several test cases, each containing a prompt asking for the nth word in a sentence and the expected answer.
