Pull request 240 proposes an evaluation method called "balance-chemical-equation" to help users balance chemical equations. The evaluation involves ChemistGPT replying with the balanced chemical equation without explanation when given an unbalanced equation as input. The evaluation data consists of several input-output pairs of unbalanced and balanced chemical equations. The usefulness of this evaluation is that GPT-3 has low accuracy in balancing chemical equations, and this evaluation can help improve the accuracy of future GPT models.
