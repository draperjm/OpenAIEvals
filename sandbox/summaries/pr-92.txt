The pull request proposes an evaluation method named "determinant" for GPT-3.5-Turbo. The evaluation involves asking GPT to calculate the determinant of matrices ranging from 1x1 to 4x4. The evaluation is considered useful because GPT currently has 0% accuracy for determinant calculations, which are important in various fields. The unique value of this evaluation is that it includes 400 samples, with 100 samples for each matrix size, and a range of values from -10 to 10, -100 to 100, and -100,000 to 100,000 to create more diversity and randomness in the values. The evaluation data is provided in JSON format, with input matrices and their corresponding ideal determinant values.
