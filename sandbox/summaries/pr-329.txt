Pull request 329 proposes an evaluation method called "ukraine-eit.val.v0" that tests GPT-4's performance on a mixed-set selection of 9470 test questions from the Ukrainian External Independent Evaluation (EIT) test, which is a government-mandated test held annually in Ukraine since 2006 to evaluate university candidates, teachers, and candidates to MS programs. The dataset was carefully mined from public domain test result sheets published by the government and filtered to account for questions containing images, tables, or mathematical formulas in MathJax. The dataset includes questions from various subjects, including Ukrainian language and literature, history of Ukraine, biology, geography, law, chemistry, learning competence, pedagogic competence, and physics. The questions include single and multiple-answer multiple choice, sequence, and set-selection questions. The dataset is useful for measuring GPT-4 performance on various learning tasks in Ukrainian and is a benchmark for how well GPT-4 is able to grasp Ukrainian language, culture, legal, and academic environments.
