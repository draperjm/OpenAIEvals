The pull request describes an evaluation method called `convert-hex-hsl-lightness` that tests a model's ability to convert a color from hex format to HSL format and extract the lightness value as an integer percentage. The evaluation involves a multi-stage process and tests the model's understanding of color, color perception, and methods for manipulating color representations. The evaluation data prompts consist of providing a hex code and asking for the lightness value as a percentage. The formulas used in the evaluation are standard and invariant, and there is a known answer to each prompt. The evaluation is useful for design applications that require an understanding of color.
