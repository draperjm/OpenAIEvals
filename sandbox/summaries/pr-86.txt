Pull request 86 adds a new evaluation method called "infiniteloop-match" to test the model's ability to recognize if a piece of code can get into a state where it would run forever. The evaluation is useful because it helps developers detect such issues before they can cause any damage. The evaluation includes 101 samples in 10+ programming languages, all selected and verified by hand. The evaluation results are reported as accuracy, with an example of the JSON data provided in the pull request.
