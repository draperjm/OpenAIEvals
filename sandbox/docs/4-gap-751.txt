8. **Korean-English Code-Switching Evaluation**: Assess GPTs' ability to understand and generate text with natural and contextually appropriate Korean-English code-switching, which is common in multilingual communication.

9. **Korean Poetic Forms Evaluation**: Test GPTs' understanding and generation of traditional Korean poetic forms, such as sijo (시조) and gasa (가사), by assessing their ability to adhere to the specific structural and thematic rules of these forms.

10. **Korean Dialects Evaluation**: Evaluate GPTs' ability to understand and generate text in various Korean dialects, such as the Gyeongsang (경상), Jeolla (전라), and Chungcheong (충청) dialects.

Here are some eval ideas that could be interesting for you as someone who dabbles in many natural languages:

1. "Korean Idioms Interpretation Evaluation": Test GPT models' understanding of Korean idioms and their ability to provide accurate explanations in Korean or other languages.

2. "Code-switching Evaluation for Multilingual GPT Models": Create an eval that tests GPT models' ability to understand and generate text with code-switching, where two or more languages are used in the same conversation or sentence.

3. "Korean Text Summarization Evaluation": Evaluate the ability of GPT models to summarize Korean texts effectively, maintaining the key information and context while reducing the length.

4. "Translation Ambiguity Evaluation": Test GPT models' ability to handle ambiguous translations between Korean and other languages, where one word or phrase could have multiple meanings in the target language.

5. "Korean Proverbs and Cultural Context Evaluation": Assess GPT models' understanding of Korean proverbs and their cultural context, and their ability to provide appropriate explanations or analogies in other languages.

6. "Korean Slang and Neologisms Evaluation": Test GPT models' ability to understand, translate, and generate text containing Korean slang and neologisms, reflecting the dynamic nature of language.

7. "Korean Poetry Generation Evaluation": Evaluate GPT models' ability to generate Korean poetry, adhering to specific poetic forms and styles while maintaining coherence and creativity.

These eval ideas focus on different aspects of Korean language understanding and the ability to work with multiple languages. You can choose one or multiple ideas to create a diverse set of evaluations that test GPT models' understanding of Korean and other languages you are familiar with."

Me: "which would be the easiest/hardest/most/least likely to be merged/etc?"

GPT-4: "It is difficult to precisely determine which eval idea would be the easiest, hardest, most likely, or least likely to be merged. However, I can provide some general insights based on the criteria for a good eval and potential challenges.

**Easiest / Most likely to be merged:**
- Korean Particles Evaluation: It focuses on a specific aspect of the Korean language that could expose the model's limitations. If designed well with a diverse set of examples, it has a good chance of being merged.

**Hardest / Least likely to be merged:**
- Old Korean to Modern Korean Evaluation: This task might be more difficult due to the complexity of translating old Korean texts to modern Korean. Moreover, creating high-quality examples and determining the right behavior might be challenging, reducing the likelihood of it being merged.

**Important Considerations:**
While selecting the easiest or hardest eval idea can be a factor, it is essential to focus on the eval's quality and relevance to expose potential limitations in GPT models. Ensure that the chosen eval idea aligns with the criteria for a good eval and addresses a relevant aspect of the Korean language or natural languages in general. This will increase the chances of the eval being merged and providing valuable insights.

It's difficult to predict with certainty which eval ideas would be the easiest/hardest or most/least likely to be merged. However, I can provide some insights based on the ideas you suggested:

Easiest / Most likely to be merged:
1. Korean proverbs and idiomatic expressions: This evaluation would test GPT models' understanding of culturally specific phrases and expressions. It could be easier to create since you can gather a list of common proverbs and idiomatic expressions and test the models on their ability to explain, translate, or use them in context.

Hardest / Least likely to be merged:
1. Multilingual wordplay: This evaluation would involve creating puns, jokes, or other forms of wordplay that involve multiple languages. This could be difficult to create and evaluate, as it requires a deep understanding of multiple languages and their nuances. Additionally, it might be challenging to assess the models' performance, especially if the humor or wordplay is subtle or relies on specific cultural knowledge.

When it comes to getting an eval merged, the key is to ensure that it meets all the criteria for a good eval, has a clear goal, and demonstrates the models' strengths and weaknesses in a meaningful and informative way. It's also important to check if there are similar evals already merged or in the process of being merged, as it might affect the chances of your submission being accepted."

Me: "the following are the themes for search on Naver Korean Dictionary. which falls under which idea?

속담 Proverb
고사성어 Chinese Idiomatic Expression
관용구 Idiom
방언 Dialect
옛말 Old Saying
북한말 North Korean Language
외래어 Loanword
로마자 Roman"

GPT-4: "I'll map the themes from the Naver Korean Dictionary to the evaluation method ideas I previously provided:

1. Cross-lingual reasoning:
   - 외래어 (Loanword)

2. Idiomatic expressions:
   - 속담 (Proverb)
   - 고사성어 (Chinese Idiomatic Expression)
   - 관용구 (Idiom)

3. Korean dialects:
   - 방언 (Dialect)
   - 북한말 (North Korean Language)

4. Multilingual translation chains:
   - 로마자 (Roman) (indirectly, as Romanized text can be a part of translation chains)

5. Language-specific phenomena:
   - 옛말 (Old Saying) (related to historical language features)

Please note that these mappings are not exclusive, and some themes may overlap with multiple evaluation method ideas. Additionally, some themes might not fit precisely into the previously mentioned ideas but could still be used as a basis for creating a unique evaluation method focused on the Korean language or multilingual understanding."
