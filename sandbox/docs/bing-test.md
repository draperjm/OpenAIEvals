how is gpt-4 better than gpt-3.5-turbo

Bing
GPT-4 is an entirely new model that incorporates additional improvements and advancements over GPT-3.5 Turbo which is an
upgraded version of the GPT-3 model¹. GPT-4 is expected to have way more parameters than GPT-3.5 Turbo which has a total
of 154 billion parameters¹. This increase in size allows the models to process and understand even more complex and
nuanced language patterns, and to generate more accurate and meaningful responses to input¹. GPT-4 is also expected to
have a more diverse range of training data, incorporating additional languages and sources beyond just English¹.
Compared to GPT-3.5, GPT-4 is smarter, can handle longer prompts and conversations, and doesn't make as many factual
errors².

mece list of test ideas for comparison

Bing
MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. It is a principle used to organize information into
distinct and non-overlapping categories. Here is a MECE list of test ideas for comparing GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo:

1. **Accuracy**: Compare the accuracy of the two models in generating responses to a given set of prompts.
2. **Speed**: Measure the time taken by each model to generate responses to a given set of prompts.
3. **Language capabilities**: Test the ability of each model to understand and generate text in multiple languages.
4. **Contextual understanding**: Evaluate the ability of each model to understand and respond to prompts that require
   contextual understanding.
5. **Coherence**: Assess the coherence of responses generated by each model over a longer conversation or text passage.

I want to know which test would show the biggest difference between the two models.

Bing
It's difficult to say which test would show the biggest difference between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo without conducting
the tests. However, based on the information available, it is likely that tests related to accuracy, language
capabilities, and contextual understanding may show significant differences between the two models. GPT-4 is expected to
have a larger model size and more diverse training data than GPT-3.5 Turbo, which could result in better performance in
these areas .

how about asking for the right idiom (such as 사자성어) when given a definition

Bing
Yes, that could be an interesting test to compare the language capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. You could
provide the definition of a 사자성어 (a four-character idiom in Korean) and see if each model is able to generate the
correct idiom. This test would evaluate the ability of each model to understand and generate text in Korean, as well as
their ability to understand the cultural context and meaning of idioms.

would that be conspicuous

Bing
It's possible that a test comparing the ability of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate the correct 사자성어 when given a
definition could show a noticeable difference between the two models. As mentioned earlier, GPT-4 is expected to have a
more diverse range of training data, incorporating additional languages and sources beyond just English. This could
result in better performance in understanding and generating text in Korean, including idioms like 사자성어.
