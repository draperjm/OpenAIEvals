Me: "im a korean who dabbles in many natural languages"

GPT-4:
### 1. "As someone who has experience with multiple natural languages and Korean, you can leverage your unique skills to develop an evaluation method that tests the language understanding and translation abilities of GPT-4.

Here are some ideas to help you create a new evaluation method:

1. Cross-lingual reasoning: Design a test that requires GPT-4 to understand and reason about information presented in different languages, including Korean. For example, given a set of facts in multiple languages, the model should be able to answer questions or solve problems based on that information.

2. Idiomatic expressions: Evaluate GPT-4's ability to understand, translate, and explain idiomatic expressions from Korean and other languages. These expressions can be particularly challenging for AI systems, as they often require knowledge of cultural context and language-specific nuances.

3. Korean dialects: Test GPT-4's understanding of different Korean dialects and regional variations. Create a set of questions or prompts that require the model to recognize and respond appropriately to these variations.

4. Multilingual translation chains: Assess GPT-4's ability to maintain the meaning of a sentence or passage when translating it through multiple languages in a chain (e.g., from Korean to English, then English to French, French to Japanese, and so on). Compare the final translation to the original Korean input to evaluate the model's accuracy and consistency.

5. Language-specific phenomena: Design an evaluation method that tests GPT-4's understanding of language-specific phenomena, such as Korean honorifics or particles. This could involve generating sentences with varying degrees of politeness or formality and asking the model to choose the most appropriate one for a given context."

### 2. "Based on the merged PR list and your background, here are a few suggestions for creating original evals:

1. **Korean Language Evaluation**: Create an evaluation that tests GPT's ability to perform tasks in the Korean language. This could include grammar correction, idiom understanding, or contextual understanding of Korean-specific phrases.

2. **Cross-lingual Comparison Evaluation**: Create an evaluation that tests GPT's ability to translate idiomatic expressions, proverbs, or slang from one language to another (including Korean). This could be a multilingual evaluation, testing the model's performance across multiple languages.

3. **Language Learning Evaluation**: Create an evaluation that tests GPT's ability to provide language learning tips or answer language-related questions. This could involve questions about grammar, pronunciation, or learning strategies for various languages.

4. **Korean Cultural Knowledge Evaluation**: Create an evaluation that tests GPT's understanding of Korean culture, history, or current events. This could include questions about famous people, historical events, or popular culture topics.

5. **Natural Language Code-switching Evaluation**: Create an evaluation that tests GPT's ability to handle code-switching between multiple languages, such as Korean and English, within the same context or conversation."

Me: "which would be the easiest/hardest/most likely to be merged/etc?"

GPT-4: "A. All of the ideas I provided can potentially meet the criteria mentioned in the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, as long as they are developed to be thematically consistent, contain failures where a human can do the task but GPT models struggle, include a good signal for the correct behavior, and consist of at least 15 high-quality examples. However, the success of these ideas as evals depends on the specific implementation and how well they address the desired criteria.

B. Here's a rough assessment of the ideas in terms of difficulty and likelihood of being merged:

1. Cross-lingual reasoning:
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Likelihood of being merged: High, if it effectively demonstrates a unique failure mode in the GPT models.

2. Idiomatic expressions:
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Likelihood of being merged: Medium to High, depending on the uniqueness and quality of the examples.

3. Korean dialects:
   - Difficulty: Medium to Hard, depending on the dialects chosen and the complexity of the examples.
   - Likelihood of being merged: Medium, as it may overlap with existing language evaluation methods.

4. Multilingual translation chains:
   - Difficulty: Hard, as it requires generating accurate translations through multiple languages.
   - Likelihood of being merged: Medium, as it may depend on the novelty and quality of the test cases.

5. Language-specific phenomena:
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Likelihood of being merged: Medium to High, depending on the uniqueness and quality of the examples and if it highlights a specific failure mode in GPT models.

Remember that these assessments are just estimations and the actual difficulty and likelihood of being merged can vary based on the quality and uniqueness of your implementation."

Me: "the following are the themes for search on Naver Korean Dictionary. which falls under which idea?

속담 Proverb
고사성어 Chinese Idiomatic Expression
관용구 Idiom
방언 Dialect
옛말 Old Saying
북한말 North Korean Language
외래어 Loanword
로마자 Roman"

GPT-4: "I'll map the themes from the Naver Korean Dictionary to the evaluation method ideas I previously provided:

1. Cross-lingual reasoning:
   - 외래어 (Loanword)

2. Idiomatic expressions:
   - 속담 (Proverb)
   - 고사성어 (Chinese Idiomatic Expression)
   - 관용구 (Idiom)

3. Korean dialects:
   - 방언 (Dialect)
   - 북한말 (North Korean Language)

4. Multilingual translation chains:
   - 로마자 (Roman) (indirectly, as Romanized text can be a part of translation chains)

5. Language-specific phenomena:
   - 옛말 (Old Saying) (related to historical language features)

Please note that these mappings are not exclusive, and some themes may overlap with multiple evaluation method ideas. Additionally, some themes might not fit precisely into the previously mentioned ideas but could still be used as a basis for creating a unique evaluation method focused on the Korean language or multilingual understanding."

Me: "i wonder if all these would meet the following criteria from PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md."

GPT-4: "Based on the provided PR template, I can summarize how each evaluation method idea might meet the criteria:

1. Cross-lingual reasoning:
   - Thematically consistent: yes, as it tests understanding and reasoning across languages.
   - Contains human-solvable failures: likely, as it challenges the model to connect information from different languages.
   - Includes good signal: can be designed with correct answers or a comprehensive rubric.
   - At least 15 high-quality examples: can be created.

2. Idiomatic expressions:
   - Thematically consistent: yes, as it focuses on understanding and translating idiomatic expressions.
   - Contains human-solvable failures: likely, as idiomatic expressions can be challenging for AI but understandable by humans.
   - Includes good signal: can be designed with correct translations or a comprehensive rubric.
   - At least 15 high-quality examples: can be created.

3. Korean dialects:
   - Thematically consistent: yes, as it tests understanding of different Korean dialects and regional variations.
   - Contains human-solvable failures: likely, as dialects can be challenging for AI but understandable by humans familiar with the variations.
   - Includes good signal: can be designed with correct answers or a comprehensive rubric.
   - At least 15 high-quality examples: can be created.

4. Multilingual translation chains:
   - Thematically consistent: yes, as it assesses the model's ability to maintain meaning through multiple translation steps.
   - Contains human-solvable failures: likely, as translation chains can introduce errors that a human translator may avoid.
   - Includes good signal: can be designed with correct translations or a comprehensive rubric.
   - At least 15 high-quality examples: can be created.

5. Language-specific phenomena:
   - Thematically consistent: yes, as it tests understanding of language-specific phenomena, such as Korean honorifics or particles.
   - Contains human-solvable failures: likely, as understanding language-specific phenomena can be difficult for AI but easier for humans familiar with the language.
   - Includes good signal: can be designed with correct answers or a comprehensive rubric.
   - At least 15 high-quality examples: can be created.

Remember, even if your evaluation meets the criteria, it does not guarantee that your PR will be merged or that you will be granted access to the GPT-4 API. However, these ideas could serve as a strong starting point for your evaluation submission."
