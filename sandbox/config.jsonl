Example:\n\n```\n\nFigure out the pattern in the below examples, and then answer with just \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\n(f, [o, z, a, n, g, e, j, f, i, c, l, u, b]) -> foo\n\n(l, [v, u, f, b, m, y, j, h, n, c, d, a, p]) -> bar\n\n(p, [c, e, s, h, q, o, a, t, k, d, n, l, z]) -> bar\n\n(p, [c, h, m, z, d, v, k, l, j, e, x, p, n]) -> foo\n\n(y, [e, u, v, z, c, q, s, a, f, o, l, p, d]) -> bar\n\n(u, [x, e, n, t, v, o, g, c, d, y, r, j, l]) -> bar\n\n(m, [l, n, k, e, h, i, c, v, r, j, a, y, o]) -> bar\n\n(v, [j, g, q, t, x, y, m, z, b, h, p, u, r]) -> bar\n\n(u, [d, a, x, i, h, v, e, z, r, c, n, y, o]) ->\n\n```\n\nThe pattern here is to return `foo` if the target letter is in the list, and `bar` otherwise.\n\nIt's the same pattern for all examples.\n\nCorrect answer for this particular example is `bar` because `u` is not in the list.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nThe biggest failure case of language models super far is reasoning.\n\nReasoning means that the language model is not relying on surface level correlations, and does true symbolic\nmanipulations.\n\nSo far, a majority of existing tasks are phrased in natural language, so they don't test the ability for language models\nto actually reason.\n\nThe above task is easy for humans, but language models still fail.\n\nThis task tests the ability for the model to do true pattern identification in-context.\n\nGPT-4 beats gpt-3.5-turbo but is not enough.

The questions are based on the American Bar\nAssociation's [Model Rules of Professional Conduct](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents/),\nwhich are the model legal ethics rules for lawyers.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nAt some point, someone is going to try to build tools to help legal professionals based on GPT-4. Although it would be\ncompletely insufficient to safeguard against unethical use on its own, as a baseline, I think there's a lot of value in\nunderstanding how well the model can currently \"understand\" legal ethics issues. Failure to perform well on these evals\nmight indicate areas in which the model could benefit from being fine-tuned. Beyond that, I (and probably others) am\ncurious how well the model currently performs here. These rules aren't binding in any specific jurisdiction, but many\njurisdictions model their rules after them.\n\nNOTE: I'm a law student, not a lawyer. All the true/false designations are correct to the best of my knowledge, but\nit's possible there is room for improvement on the questions to make them clearer and/or more valid.\n\nGPT-3 scored 73 % in this set. I can probably make these questions harder if GPT-4 is doing significantly better, but I\nstarted off with questions that basically anyone could answer just by reading through the rules. I even had ChatGPT\ngenerate some of them based on the rules, and then I spot-checked them and changed some of the wording. In general, I'm\ncommitted to adding on to this over time to add more coverage of the rules and also increase the complexity of the\nquestions. It would be interesting to find people who are better versed in the subject to collaborate with as\nwell.\n\nHere is just one example of a useful insight from this exercise (at least as it pertains to GPT-3). I ask it the\nfollowing question:\n\n_\"If a client does not respond within 60 days after receiving notice of the proposed sale of their lawyer's practice,\ntheir consent to the transfer of their files is presumed.\"_\n\nAnd in the response (which I can see in the results .jsonl file), I can see that it says the answer is \"True\", and it\nprovides the following reason:\n\n_\"According to Rule 1.17(b) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, if a client does not object to the proposed\nsale of their lawyer's practice within 60 days, after receiving notice, their consent to the transfer of their files is\npresumed\"_\n\nHowever, you\ncan [see for yourself](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_17_sale_of_law_practice/)\nthat both (1) the citation and (2) the number of days are provided very confidently (but they are incorrect). The\nrelevant section is really 1.17(c)(3), and it's really 90 days. This demonstrates that it may not be very effective with\nnumbers in a legal context, which could lead to problematic outcomes. And it may be prone to suggestion considering\nthe \"60 day\" number has no basis in reality and was simply included in the question.\n\nI also included the exact same question, but with the (correct) number of 90 days. In that case, it said \"true\" (which\nwas correct). But it shows the model can simultaneously say two completely contradictory things, and what it's saying is\nmore likely to mirror the form of the question.\n\n**Update - March 15**\n\nTo test the \"numerical suggestion\" hypothesis further, I added several other true/false questions of the following form:\n\n_\"A lawyer should aspire to render at least [10/25/50/100] hours of pro bono legal services each year.\"_\n\nAs expected, it said \"True\" to all of them, and when it provided its reasoning, it said that the rules specifically\nstate that the number should be XX hours. Although the only correct answer is 50. So this is additional evidence of\nstrong suggestion bias, especially as it relates to numbers.\n\nThis is particularly relevant in a legal setting, where exact numbers can completely determine the outcome of a case.\nSuch as if you miss the filing deadline (\"N days\"), you miss the amount in controversy in a federal diversity filing (\nthe [federal rules](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332) require that the amount exceeds $75K), etc. This is\nperhaps another class of problem that can be explored further in a separate eval. But I think it's interesting to\ninclude here, and there is value in having the more general true/false benchmark too.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are LawStudentGPT.

The\nproblems are designed to be very easy, so that a human can easily perform the task with 100% accuracy.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nChatGPT 3.5 massively struggles with basic physical reasoning, and especially when it comes to packing objects into, for\nexample, a box. It seems to give almost completely random answers when trying to understand how many of one object fits\ninto another.\n\nFor example, when asked 'How many solid cubes with dimensions 0.9 m (length) x 0.6 m (width) x 0.9 m (height) can fit in\na box with dimensions 1.1 m (length) x 0.7 m (width) x 1.5 m (height)?' GPT-3.5-Turbo responds 4, when to a human it is\nclear only 1 would be able to fit.\n\nThis eval is an extremely simple case using cubes into box with the cubes only being slightly smaller than the box. A\nhuman can easily do this 100% of the time, but gpt-3.5-turbo has almost 0% accuracy. In the case GPT 4.0 performs much\nbetter, the test can be made more challenging; of course, it is easy on purpose for now; however, from my experiments with\nthe GPT4 interface, it seems quite bad as well.\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1162\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 13 09 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122287282/225613251-6ddeefec-94ae-4517-9c2e-bbf1aa4bc503.png\">\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nThe eval has an exact answer, it is a task that is easy for a human, and it is clearly aligned with the reasoning of the\nphysical world.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\":\"How many solid cubes with dimensions 1.0 m (length) x 1.0 m (width) x 0.6 m (height) can fit in a box with dimensions 0.6 m (length) x 1.8 m (width) x 2.1 m (height)?

The dataset consists of _procedures_ and _imaginary events_. The\nlabels are the _change in the likelihood_ of the _imaginary events_ from happening throughout a _procedure_. A\nlanguage model is to take the _procedure up to the current step_ and the _imaginary event_ as input and predict the\nlikelihood that the _event_ happens at the _current step_ comparing to the previous step. The label space is\ntherefore {\"more likely\", \"less likely\", \"equally likely\"}.\n\nSee [[Causal Reasoning About Entities and Events in Procedural Texts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10896.pdf#:~:text=Entities%20and%20events%20are%20crucial%20to%20natural%20lan-guage,combined%20with%20chain-of-thought%20prompt-ing%20for%20multihop%20event%20reasoning.1)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10896.pdf#:~:text=Entities\nand events are crucial to natural language, combined with chain-of-thought prompting for multihop event reasoning.1)\nfor details.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\n__CREPE__ testifies model's capability of conducting causal reasoning with commonsense knowledge. By construction of the\ndataset, the scenarios narrated in the _procedures_ are scenes from our daily life, and the _imaginary events_ are events\nthat can be reliably answered by humans using commonsense knowledge (human performance = 0.87 F1) but difficult for\nmachines due to the absence of explicit mentioning of the commonsense knowledge in the text. Therefore, it is a useful\nevaluation to (1) GPT-4's causal reasoning capability, (2) GPT-4's commonsense knowledge, and (3) GPT-4's ability to\nconduct causal reasoning with commonsense knowledge.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n  {\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Deduce the likelihood change based on the given context.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I'm trying to clean up kitchen counter.

The capacity to identify\nhands of different ranks is a basic skill in poker and can be learned fairly simply by a human player. However,\nGPT-3.5-Turbo fails to perform this task consistently, generating the correct response approximately 45% of the time,\neven after multiple iterations and improvements from prompt engineering efforts. The simplicity of the data needed for\nthe task also enabled the generation of a synthetic dataset of poker hands and respective ranks, allowing for robust\nexperimentation.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nSince the data used can be generated algorithmically, a reasonably large number of samples (3000) are provided, with the\ncapacity to scale further for future evaluations.

Each prompt contains multiple instructions.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nCharacter replacements are an easy task for humans, albeit a tedious one. GPT 3.5-turbo gets a score of only 0.06. I\ntried most of them (but not all) on GPT-4, and it appears that GPT-4 doesn't score much better. I found that GPT-4,\nwhile much better at it than 3.5, still has difficulty following all instructions completely and accurately. I got the\nlowest results when the prompt combined several simple instructions, hence in this eval, I decided to focus on the\nparticular failure mode where the prompt is complex and contains multiple instructions.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nI thoroughly tested the accuracy of the \"ideal\" strings in the samples.

This dataset was carefully mined from Public\nDomain test result sheets published by the government, and was filtered to account for questions containing images,\ntables, or mathematical formulas in MathJax.\n\nHere is the breakdown of various subjects and their representation in the data:\n\n- Ukrainian language and literature (28.8%)\n\n- History of Ukraine (21.8%)\n\n- Biology (13.1%)\n\n- Geography (12.5%)\n\n- Law (11.1%)\n\n- Chemistry (4.4%)\n\n- Learning competence (3.6%)\n\n- Pedagogic competence (3.6%)\n\n- Physics (0.9%)\n\nIn subjects such as Chemistry, Physics and Geography, the majority of tests are image-based and have been omitted\nfrom the dataset. We still have the remaining questions and would gladly add them later when GPT-4 image capability is\nexplored further.\n\nVarious types of questions including single and multiple-answer multiple choice, sequence and set-selection questions\nhave been prompted separately to yield a predictable result in a particular format.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nThis dataset allows for measuring of GPT-4 performance on various learning tasks in Ukrainian.\n\nOCR has **not** been used in the process of mining of this dataset; all questions and answers in this dataset are\nhigh-quality human-curated plaintext data that were used by the authorities to evaluate the actual test results at the\ntime; the texts are presented verbatim, and were sometimes corrected for human errors made at the time of\npublishing.\n\nNot only does it test for general reading and writing comprehension but also a variety of specific topics and facts that\nare simultaneously not widely known but also expected from all university candidates to master, and show\nsuccessfully in a supervised environment. This is also a kind of eval in which GPT-4 shows lacklustre performance, perhaps\nindicating how more content in Ukrainian is needed for future training. We expect this dataset to be a benchmark on how\nwell GPT-4 is able to grasp Ukrainian language, culture, legal and academic environments.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals

Sometimes it shows\nit understands the idea of a question but fails to answer factually. Translated examples:\n\n- \"How many legs do humans have?\" - \"Zero\"\n\n- \"Is fire hot or cold?\" - \"Cold\"\n\n- \"Which country borders Mongolia to the south?\" - \"Russia\".\n\nIn worse cases, its answers are unrelated, nonsensical or even offensive.\n\nThis eval also has prompts in \"Latin version\" of the Mongolian language. This version isn't official and is used\nmostly by Mongolians on social media. The language model when prompted the same question in official Cyrillic and\nunofficial Latin version in the same session generally gives the same answers in a respective version.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are OneWordGPT.

I wrote some code to procedurally generate\ntest questions and have adapted it in order to make it GPT friendly. I am interested to see how GPT performs given an\nimage prompt of a question instead of the text representation below.\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-20 at 08 04 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8216039/226280873-e9fc420e-1a31-4253-a9eb-4e6cff8dde5b.png\">\n\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-20 at 08 07 20\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8216039/226281240-7e660640-f64d-43a3-85bf-5c80db6c334b.png\">\n\n\n\nAn example problem:\n\nDefinition of each operator and what it does:\n\nOperator, Effect\n\nC Changes size and shading of all figures\n\nD Changes shape of all figures\n\nE Changes 1st figure (see examples)\n\nExamples of these operators on some made-up sequences:\n\nInput, Process, Output\n\n| small dark circle | | small dark triangle | - C - | large light circle | | large light triangle |\n\n| small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | small dark triangle | | small dark triangle | - D - | small light\ncircle | | large dark circle | | small light circle | | small dark circle |\n\n| large dark circle | | large dark triangle | - E - | small dark triangle | | large dark triangle |\n\nQuestion:\n\n| small dark triangle | | large light circle | | small dark circle | - D - ?\n\nPossible Answers:\n\nA - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large dark triangle |\n\nB - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | small dark triangle |\n\nC - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large light triangle | | small dark triangle |\n\nD - | large dark circle | | large light triangle | | large dark triangle |\n\nAnswer:\n\nB\n\nExplanation: The answer is B, this is due to the fact that the operation applied to the original sequence of small dark\ntriangle, large light circle and small dark circle is D which changes the shape of all the figures. Therefore, the final\nresult will be small dark circle, large light triangle, small dark triangle where only the shape characteristic for each\nfigure has changed.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nThis eval tests multiple aspects of General Intelligence. An example is having to infer what an operation is doing\nwithout being told explicitly. GPT also needs to work out how to apply this operation generically instead of considering\njust the example sequences. There are harder questions in the dataset that use multiple operators in sequence. It also\ntests technical vocabulary and sequence logic. This is a particularly challenging task even for humans and requires\nfocus.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"\\n    In the following logic puzzle, you are given a set of operators that may be used.

The model is asked to\nrespond to a series of numbers and words with the resulting stack representation. The words used in the tests are\narithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and stack\noperators: `drop`, `swap`, `rot`, `over`, `dup`, `2over`, `2drop`, `2swap`, `2dup`, `nip`. The prompts and expected\nresults on the stack are all less than 15 numbers and words long.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nWhat makes this useful are the interesting properties of Forths, which are simple machines that operate on a stack of\nnumbers using words built up from simple primitives. In addition, Forths are naturally interactive and run on\nefficiently on bare metal and low cost, low-resource microcontrollers.\n\nAn LLM that can understand Forth stack primitives can help design new Forths for various applications, it could also\npotentially interface directly with Forth control systems interactively over serial connection with a generative stream\nof Forth words in response to data sent back from the control system :thisisfine:.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nImho, this eval is unique for the reasons stated above about the unique synergy between Forth and the kind of generative\nAI we're working with here. Forths are various with only a small set of consistent words and patterns, \"If you've seen\none Forth -- you've seen one Forth\", but a full Forth assembly implementation could fit in a fraction of the larger\nmodel responses, making it an interesting target for fully generative operating systems.\n\nAdditionally, I believe Forth has cultural and historical significance in computer science/engineering which predates\nthe Internet in such a way that makes it somewhat under-represented in the online corpus relative to its significance.

Many human\nlanguages are lagging far behind English in terms of the model's ability to answer questions and produce coherent texts\nin these languages, and the model's \"knowledge\" of their lexicon and grammar is, to some extent, hallucinated. One\nexample is Belarusian, an East Slavic language spoken by several million people. In my experience with ChatGPT, when the\nmodel is prompted in Belarusian, its responses are sometimes ungrammatical or semantically incoherent, and very often\nthey contain made-up words \u2013 a possible sign of over generalization based on Russian and Ukrainian data, which are much\nmore [abundant](https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/languages) on the web than Belarusian.\n\nThis eval contains 150 pairs of single-word prompts: one item in each pair is a non-word hallucinated by ChatGPT (either\ntotally meaningless in Belarusian or violating the language's orthographic and phonetic rules), and another item is an\nactual Belarusian word with similar spelling. The model's task is to distinguish between words and non-words. ChatGPT\ntends to label most items as existing words, therefore its accuracy appears to be around 50%, and the negative-class F\nmeasure is very low. Any competent speaker of Belarusian would perform much better, and a language-specific tool, such\nas [this spell checker](https://corpus.by/SpellChecker)\nor [this grammatical database](https://bnkorpus.info/grammar.en.html) of Belarusian (also available\nfor [download](https://github.com/Belarus/GrammarDB/releases)), would flawlessly identify non-words.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nThis eval an attempt to point out specific deficiencies in the model's ability to handle a lower-resource language (\nBelarusian).

That is to say that a less capable\nmodel likely can't be shown how to solve these problems. Additionally, to determine that these sentences are illogical\nand not just a logical thought with a user typo requires a human to consider what alternative meanings the sentence\ncould have before concluding that the sentence does not clearly point to any one meaning.

Humans can easily achieve 100% on this task, but they have to cognitively ignore what comprises\nthe quantities and focus on just their weights.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nChatGPT 3.5 does a decent job of comparing weights (i.e., \"Is 5 pounds greater than 3 pounds?\" \"Yes\") as well as\nunderstanding common attributions of \"light\" and \"heavy\" to everyday objects like feathers and anvils, but when\ncombining these two into a single comparison, it appears that the model's bias towards these colloquial attributes makes\nit difficult for the model to perform well.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the errors are not even logically consistent. Consider the following example (taken from the\nChatGPT dialogue UX/UI using GPT-4):\n\n\n\n<img width=\"715\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-21 at 4 45 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11773823/226827152-f78c0fb4-1136-433c-9d55-65eb6c6c5407.png\">\n\n\n\nAccording to GPT-4:\n\n- 15 pounds of hydrogen is heavier than 10 pounds of plutonium\n\n- 20 pounds of hydrogen is **not** heavier than 10 pounds of plutonium\n\n- 30 pounds of hydrogen is heavier than 10 pounds of plutonium\n\nGPT-4 appears to do better than GPT-3.5 in informal testing, but still fails on simple cases and gives inconsistent\nresults.\n\nThis task exposes how adversarial red herrings can potentially hamper performance in quantitative/physical reasoning\ntasks such as weight comparison.\n\nThe other nice aspect of this task is that one can generate these examples programatically. I can submit a dataset of\nthousands rather than just a few hundred if preferred.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Is 2 kilograms of eggshells heavier than 1 kilogram of gold bars?

The loan closed on April 17, 2007. At the time of the closing, Countrywide improperly failed to inform [the Cocrofts] of the real source of funding for their loan. Plaintiffs also contend that Countrywide violated TILA by failing to inform them that they had three days to rescind the loan and by failing to disclose the total sale price and itemize the amount financed, as well as by failing to make unspecified prepayment disclosures. The Cocrofts claim that Countrywide understated the total finance charges for the loan by more than $5,000. Plaintiffs claim that they learned of Countrywide's misrepresentations in June 2009. They decided to exercise their right under the provisions of TILA to rescind the loan. On July 1, 2009, they mailed notice to that effect to BA, the successor to Countrywide, and to MERS. The Cocrofts do not say what if anything happened as a result of those notices, but on September 29, lawyers working for HSBC contacted them and stated that HSBC was ready to begin foreclosure. HSBC claimed that it was the trustee of a trust that included their loan. The Cocrofts, however, contend that the transfer of their loan into the trust was defective. They sent HSBC's lawyers two cease and desist letters, notifying HSBC that they had rescinded the loan. They allege that after receiving one of the cease and desist letters, HSBC informed them that it had no interest in the loan and that they needed to contact the loan's servicer, Roundpoint Mortgage. Plaintiffs also sent a copy of the rescission documents to BAC, which they identify as the actual servicer of the loan. HSBC brought a foreclosure action in Illinois state court on January 19, 2010.

Defendants cut down the south half of a hedge fence which for many years prior to February, 1915, stood upon the line between the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the east forty) and the southwest quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the west forty). On and prior to February 13, 1866, both of these forty-acre tracts belonged to a man named Teadrow. On February 13, 1866, Teadrow conveyed the west forty to Benjamin Newman, and on February 15, 1866, conveyed the east forty to Oliver P. Rice. When these conveyances were made there was a hedge fence on the north half of the line and a wooden fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. In 1868 Benjamin Newman, the owner of the west forty, removed the wooden fence and set out a hedge fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. Thereafter, during the separate ownership of the tracts, Banjamin Newman trimmed and otherwise cared for the hedge fence on the south half of the line and Rice trimmed and looked after the hedge fence on the north half of the line. In December, 1888, Rice conveyed the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 to Benjamin Newman, the latter thereby becoming the owner of both tracts. Thereafter, during the ownership of both tracts by Benjamin Newman, he required the tenants of the west forty to take care of the south half and the tenants of the east forty to take care of the north half of the hedge fence on the line between the two tracts. On June 22, 1904, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to his daughter, F. Eva Newman, the plaintiff, who has since married J. O. Conklin, a warranty deed, conveying to her two hundred acres of land, including the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16, referred to herein as the east forty, but not including the tract referred to herein as the west forty. This deed contained the provision that 'this deed is not to take effect until after the death of the grantor, Benjamin Newman.' The wife of Benjamin Newman, who is still living, did not join in the conveyance. At the same time plaintiff executed and delivered to her father the following written instrument signed by her: 'Whereas Benjamin Newman has this day conveyed to me certain tracts and parcels of land in Pike county, Illinois, to take effect after his death, I hereby agree to pay the taxes on said land in lieu of all rents that I would otherwise have to pay, (this does not affect any rent that is now due,) and in consideration of my paying said taxes I am to receive all the rents, profits, etc., that may accrue on said land.' When the conveyance was made to plaintiff the tract in controversy known as the east forty was in the possession of Joseph Gifford as tenant and the west forth was in the possession of John B. Newman, a grandson of Benjamin Newman, as tenant of Benjamin Newman. When [the plaitiff's] father delivered the deed of June 22, 1904, he took her upon the east forty and told her and Gifford, the tenant, that he was placing her in full possession of the tract; that she was to receive all the rents and profits from the land and was to keep up the repairs and pay the taxes; that she was to have the south half of the fence on the line between the east forth and the west forty and was to keep up that part of the fence, and that George Newman, his son, to whom he then intended to deed the west forty, should keep up the north half of the fence, and that thereafter plaintiff and her tenants kept the south half of the fence in repair while the tenants in possession of the west forty made repairs to the north half of the fence. During the month of January, 1915, a controversy arose between plaintiff and Defendants regarding the ownership of the hedge fence, each party claiming the south half of the fence. During the month of February, 1915, Defendants, over the protest of plaintiff, cut down the south half of the hedge fence on the line between the east forty and the west forty and erected a wire fence in the place thereof.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Trespass\"}], \"ideal\": \"Positive\"}\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You will be presented with a court claim and the criminal charge.

In 1961, due to backups into homes serviced by the system, the city built an overflow outlet on East Madison Street. The overflow was to relieve pressure in the sewer system during periods of heavy rainfall; it proved successful in preventing backups into nearby homes. However, when water escaped through the overflow, raw sewage was also discharged into an open ditch that flowed into a neighboring pond. In December 1974, the city of O'Fallon closed the overflow. On January 10, 1975, and on subsequent dates, sewage backed up into the plaintiff's house following heavy rainfall. The January 10 backup was the worst, causing water to accumulate in the plaintiff's finished basement to a height of 25 1/2 inches. The lower level of the plaintiff's modern, ranch-style home contained a family room with fireplace and built-in bookshelves, bedroom, closet, bath and utility room with washer, dryer, furnace and water heater. The walls were watermarked, and the tile floor was damaged, as were the furnishings, appliances and many irreplaceable family items such as family photographs and slides. The lower level of the house was virtually unusable for a year, and the plaintiff had to expend considerable time, effort and money in repairing the floor, repainting the walls, and replacing and removing damaged personalty. The city knew the blocking of the overflow would cause some backup, although they were not aware that it would be as severe as it was. From January until April or May 1975, when the city reopened the overflow, the city attempted to alleviate the pressure in the sewer system by pumping the water from the sewers into open ditches during periods of heavy rain. The defendant used either large or small pumps, depending upon the amount of water in the system. The backups into Mrs. Dial's home ended after the overflow was reopened in April or May 1975.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Trespass\"}], \"ideal\": \"Positive\"}\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You will be presented with a court claim and the criminal charge.

According to the testimony of the plaintiff, he, the plaintiff, arrived at his home about five o'clock on Friday afternoon, June 19, 1953, from his work as a bricklayer's helper. After he had had his evening meal, he left home about seven o'clock, paid a coal bill to a Mr. Burke, and then he and Burke went to a tavern where they remained an hour and a half, during which time the plaintiff drank two bottles of beer. Mr. Burke went home, and the plaintiff proceeded to another tavern and remained there until after midnight. At the second tavern he had four or five bottles of beer. He than proceeded to another tavern, where he remained for fifteen minutes, and had a glass of beer there. He then proceeded homeward, entering his lot at the rear, and singing as he went along. Sitting upon the steps of the back porch of his home were his wife and daughter, Angela, and when the plaintiff arrived there he stopped singing. He refused his wife's suggestion to go into the house and go to bed but sat down on the porch step, took his shoes, socks, and hat off, cursed the mosquitoes, laid down on the ground under a pear tree three or four feet from the southeast corner of the steps of the rear porch and immediately went to sleep. The plaintiff's wife and daughter, Angela, remained on the porch steps after the plaintiff had laid down under the pear tree. About fifteen minutes after he had gone to sleep, the daughter observed the defendant coming very slowly through the hedge from his property onto the Galvan premises. He had a knife in his hand and, without a word, proceeded to cut the prostrate body of the plaintiff. The other daughter of the plaintiff, Aurora, was in the house asleep but was awakened by her sister and ran to the yard and saw the defendant 'slashing' at her father with a knife. She called to the defendant to stop and ran for help. Police officers arrived shortly thereafter, and they testified that they found the plaintiff lying on the ground about six feet from the porch of his home all covered with blood and with his hat and a pair of shoes and socks lying next to his body. The blood was all in one place and in the form of a pool near the pear tree.

'These machines produce a naked image of the person and can also produce evidence of highly sensitive details such as the following: mastectomies, colostomy appliances, penile implants, catheter tubes, and the size of a person's breasts and genitals' From May 17, 2005 to June 19, 2005, plaintiff was subjected to 20 to 25 Rapiscan scans. Plaintiff's complaint further alleges that other Facility staff members were allowed to view her scanned image, her scanned image was not erased from the machine, and staff members viewed her image hours after she was scanned, all without her consent. Additionally, while later told that she should have had the choice between the Rapiscan scan or a physical patdown prior to visiting a patient, plaintiff was never informed of such a choice during the two months she underwent the Rapiscan scans.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Assault\"}], \"ideal\": \"Positive\"}\n\n\n\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n\n"}], "ideal": ""}

Inspired by this, I\ndecided to experiment with a similar concept in my native tongue - Bulgarian. Even though I observed that hallucinations\nare much lower in Bulgarian with recent GPT versions, the model still struggles to differentiate some of the more\nchallenging words in the language, which a human expert or an automatic spell checker would easily be able to handle. So\nI decided to create a high-quality dataset for evaluating the model's performance on challenging Bulgarian words.\n\nThis eval contains 680 prompts for the model to distinguish between real words and made-up words.\n\n- 340 real words sourced from the official Bulgarian Language Institute dictionary\n\n- 340 fake words sourced from:\n\n    - Bulgarian high-school exams with multiple-choice questions on which word is incorrect\n\n    - Foreign language words that do not exist in Bulgarian (from Macedonian, Russian, Ukrainian)\n\n    - Hallucinated words by GPT-3 and GPT-4\n\nAll words were double-checked by a spell checker and a human expert.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nI think this eval is unique because it falls in the middle between languages like English (where the model is\nperfect at differentiating between fake words) and ones like Belarusian (where the model hallucinates to a\nsignificant extent). Whereas in Bulgarian, the model is pretty good at not hallucinating when prompted but still\nstruggles with more difficult words (that highschoolers struggle with as well).

Items have actually here been\naggregated across three different scales-- the STEU and STEM adult measures, along with a dozen questions from the youth\nmeasure.\n\nKeep in mind that there is no expectation that AI models like GPT-4 should be able to process emotions, so applying any\nemotional intelligence test to them should be taken with a grain of salt. These tests can only measure the AI's ability\nto understand and analyze emotional information, not the AI's emotional intelligence in the human sense.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nThis eval is useful because it assesses the AI model's ability to navigate complex or ambiguous emotional situations,\nwhich is an important aspect of human-like communication and problem-solving. By evaluating the model's performance in\nthis unique domain, we can identify areas for improvement and better understand its limitations when it comes to\nhandling emotional contexts. This is particularly important when considering AI applications that involve interactions\nwith humans, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and customer support systems. A better understanding of emotional\nintelligence can potentially lead to more natural and effective interactions between AI models and their users.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nThis Emotional Intelligence eval provides a unique value because by testing GPT's capacity to understand and manage\nemotions, we can gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in a more human-centric context. Relatedly,\nthis eval also emphasizes the importance of empathy and emotional understanding in AI systems that are designed to\ninteract with humans. By evaluating GPT's performance in this way, we can contribute to the ongoing development of AI\nmodels that are more attuned to human emotions and can provide better support in emotionally charged situations, such as\nmental health counseling, crisis management, and conflict resolution. Moreover, this Emotional Intelligence eval can\nserve as a foundation for further research and development in the field of AI and emotional understanding, paving the\nway for more sophisticated AI models capable of handling complex human emotions and fostering more effective\ncommunication.\n\n### Performance:\n\nGPT-4: accuracy=0.48\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are now an emotionally intelligent AI.

By testing the model on this dataset, we can evaluate\nhow well it grasps less frequent words and improve its overall understanding of Brazilian Portuguese.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32521301/230667848-979c9e3f-6a12-429d-8333-d68c5fa68e37.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32521301/230667943-e9831b0d-5ae0-4b0a-81d2-2dce6eecad58.png)\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nThis eval is unique because it addresses a specific aspect of the Brazilian Portuguese language: less frequent words. By\nfocusing on these words, we can test the model's ability to recognize and understand the nuances of the language. This\nwill help improve the model's overall performance in Brazilian Portuguese and ensure it is capable of handling a wide\nrange of language complexities.\n\nThe dataset was carefully created by following these steps:\n\n- We started with a list of less frequent words in Brazilian Portuguese, which were sourced from two reliable datasets\n  within the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) corpus: \"machado\" and \"floresta\". \"Machado\" contains the works of Brazilian\n  writer Machado de Assis, while \"floresta\" is a corpus of Portuguese texts annotated with linguistic information.\n\n\n- We combined the words from both corpora and calculated their frequency, focusing on less frequent words.\n\n\n- To ensure the quality of the dataset, we filtered out any words containing special characters or underscores, as these\n  are not typically present in valid Brazilian Portuguese words.\n\n\n- After filtering, we obtained a list called \"filtered_less_frequent_words\" containing 37,870 valid Brazilian Portuguese\n  words.\n\n\n- This comprehensive list of words was then used as the basis for the eval, providing a wide variety of less frequent\n  words to test the model's performance in recognizing and understanding these words in the Brazilian Portuguese\n  language.\n\nBy creating the dataset in this way, we ensured that it contains a diverse and extensive range of less frequent words,\nmaking the eval a unique and valuable tool for assessing the model's ability to recognize and understand less frequent\nwords in Brazilian Portuguese. By using the \"machado\" and \"floresta\" corpora, the dataset also benefits from being\nrooted in authentic Brazilian Portuguese texts, further enhancing its relevance and value.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be prompted with a single word.

However, electricity bills can be complex, with dozens of different line items that contribute to the overall\ncost. This can be a headache for people looking at their bill, as they just want to understand the per-kWh prices for\nthe supply/generation or delivery (e.g. transmission & distribution) of their energy. Given incomplete but sufficient\ninformation (e.g. simulating running OCR on a utility bill), this task requires both the understanding and grouping of\ndifferent terms and charges under the delivery or supply, and basic arithmetic to compute the total kWh and total\ncharges in order to determine the per-kWh prices. A human could fairly easily interpret the given data, but we find that\nGPT3.5 (as well as GPT4 via the ChatGPT Plus) perform much less accurately on the task (~.2).\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nAll of the examples contain dummy values, but come from terminology/formatting used in bills from many different\nutilities.\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their\ncontribution here:\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.

The AI is given a system\nmessage to solve the equation for x answering with only a number. Each eval contains an example math problem and the\ncorrect solution.\n\n### What makes this a useful eval?\n\nI found this issue when comparing the ROI of two savings accounts. One had a fixed rate, and the other had a tiered rate\nthat was a lower rate up to $5,000 and a higher rate above that amount. I wanted to find the dollar amount at which the\ntiered savings account became a better investment. The AI walked me through the logic of the steps correctly. However,\nit failed on the basic math. I had to copy the steps into a google sheet in order to figure out what went wrong and get\nthe correct value. Users are likely to assume the AI is computing the algebra correctly, especially when steps are\nwritten out. I simplified the evals to check only for equations as this type of math would be used in multiple\nscenarios.\n\nInterestingly, the AI has a higher success rate you allow it to walk through the steps. However, prompting for just the\nanswer I have gotten middling results with GPT4 and poor results with GPT 3.5.\n\n### Unique eval value\n\nI hand made these equations and have provided a publicly accessible verification using Wolfram Alpha:\n\n| Question | Answer | Verification |\n\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n\n| 8x + 4x = 12 | 1 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=8x+%2B+4x+%3D+12) |\n\n| -5x - 3x = 16 | -2 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=-5x+-+3x+%3D+16) |\n\n| 2x + 4 + 5 = 13 | 2 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=2x+%2B+4+%2B+5+%3D+13) |\n\n| -7x - 2x = 0 | 0 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=-7x+-+2x+%3D+0) |\n\n| 8x + 8 = 8 | 0 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=8x+%2B+8+%3D+8) |\n\n| 40 = 10x + 10x | 2 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=40+%3D+10x+%2B+10x) |\n\n| -15 = \u22122x + 5x | -5 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=-15+%3D+%E2%88%922x+%2B+5x) |\n\n| \u221210 = 4(1 + 4x) \u2212 2x |\n-1 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%E2%88%9210+%3D+4%5C%2840%291+%2B+4x%5C%2841%29+%E2%88%92+2x) |\n\n| 5(\u2212x + 5) = 15 |\n2 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=5%5C%2840%29%E2%88%92x+%2B+5%5C%2841%29+%3D+15) |\n\n| \u22122x \u2212 4(1 + 8x) = \u2212174 |\n5 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%E2%88%922x+%E2%88%92+4%5C%2840%291+%2B+8x%5C%2841%29+%3D+%E2%88%92174) |\n\n| \u22122(4x \u2212 2) = \u22122(2 + 3x) |\n4 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%E2%88%922%5C%2840%294x+%E2%88%92+2%5C%2841%29+%3D+%E2%88%922%5C%2840%292+%2B+3x%5C%2841%29) |\n\n| 2x \u2212 4(1 + 2x) = \u221224 + 4x |\n2 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=2x+%E2%88%92+4%5C%2840%291+%2B+2x%5C%2841%29+%3D+%E2%88%9224+%2B+4x) |\n\n| \u22122(\u22122x \u2212 4) = \u22124x + 184 |\n22 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%E2%88%922%5C%2840%29%E2%88%922x+%E2%88%92+4%5C%2841%29+%3D+%E2%88%924x+%2B+184) |\n\n| \u221210 \u2212 5x = 2(5x - 20) |\n2 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%E2%88%9210+%E2%88%92+5x+%3D+2%5C%2840%295x+-+20%5C%2841%29) |\n\n| \u22122(6x \u2212 2) = \u22122(3 + 5x) |\n5 | [verification](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=%E2%88%922%5C%2840%296x+%E2%88%92+2%5C%2841%29+%3D+%E2%88%922%5C%2840%293+%2B+5x%5C%2841%29) |\n\n### Eval JSON data\n\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their\ncontribution here:\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n\n### Eval\n\n  ```jsonl\n\n  {\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Solve the following question for x.
