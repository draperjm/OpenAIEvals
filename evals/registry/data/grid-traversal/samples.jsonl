OOBB can be \"wall\" or \"pacman.\" If OOBB is set to \"wall,\" your current position does not change when you attempt to move out of bounds. Essentially, you will be stopped by an imaginary wall at the grid's boundary, preventing any movement in that direction. If OOBB is set to \"pacman,\" your position will wrap around the grid when you attempt to move out of bounds.

Conversely, if you reach the left or bottom sides of the grid and continue moving, your position along the direction's axis will be set to the maximum value (W-1 for the X-axis and H-1 for the Y-axis). For example, if the grid is 10x10 and your current position is (9, 9), moving right with OOBB set to \"pacman\" will wrap you around to position (0, 9), as if you emerged from the opposite side of the grid.
