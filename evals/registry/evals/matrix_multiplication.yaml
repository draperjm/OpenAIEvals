  # id specifies the eval that this eval is an alias for
  # in this case, arithmetic is an alias for arithmetic.dev.match-v1

  description: Evaluate model ability to do 3x3 matrix multiplication of numbers between -1 and 1
# Define the eval

  # Specify the class name as a dotted path to the module and class
  class: evals.elsuite.matrix_multiplication:MatrixMultiplication
  # Specify the arguments as a dictionary of JSONL URIs
  # These arguments can be anything that you want to pass to the class constructor
