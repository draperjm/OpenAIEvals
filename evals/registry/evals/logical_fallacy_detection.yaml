# A group of evals that test GPT models on logical fallacy detection task. 
# Data taken from here: https://github.com/causalNLP/logical-fallacy/tree/main/data 
# (edu_test mainly, only examples for few-shot prompting from edu_train). 
# Fallacies names and definitions taken also from: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09992
