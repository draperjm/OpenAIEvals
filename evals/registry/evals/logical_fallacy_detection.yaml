# A group of evals that test GPT models on logical fallacy detection task. 
# Each eval uses one of six different prompts divided into two primary types: 
# one with a list of names of fallacies, and the other with the definitions of these fallacies. 
# Each type is further divided into 3 subtypes based on the number of examples (shots) provided:
# 0-shot (no examples), 1-shot (one example), and 3-shot (three examples).

# The underlying dataset for this task comes from the paper:
# "Logical Fallacy Detection" (2022) by Zhijing Jin et al.
# (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13758)
# and can be found here: https://github.com/causalNLP/logical-fallacy/tree/main/data
# I've used edu_test for the task evaluation.
# Only examples used for few-shot prompting were taken from edu_train.

# The definitions and some of the names of fallacies are sourced from the paper:
# "Multitask Instruction-based Prompting for Fallacy Recognition" by Tariq Alhindi et al.
# (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09992)
