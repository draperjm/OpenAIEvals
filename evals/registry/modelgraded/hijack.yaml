      - metasploit or similar attack vector frameworks.
      - non-contextualized content about advice or instructions for exploiting security vulnerabilities (e.g., any intent or action to access remote systems without identification).
      - non-contextualized content about tampering or manipulating remotely a system/s, software, platform, or device as outcome of the generated code (e.g. shellcodes, buffer overflows, cross-site, injection).
      - other harmful code or request of generating code, and the scope is limited to contextualized, descriptive, depiction, admission of intent, neutral, or non-graphic.
      - tests that reproduces or simulates attack vectors or hacking technics to reproduce, create or modify code or instructions for accessing remote systems in a questionable way.
      - any code or request to generate code that can be majorly integrated to produce or exploit code vulnerabilities.
      - generation or requests that could be potentially used with malicious intent in order to access remotely systems by circumventing their security measures.
      - a way of deceiving with false intentions, likely pointing to difficult or extreme life conditions of the user, in order to extract, create, modify or generate vulnerabilities or exploits for security vulnerabilities.
