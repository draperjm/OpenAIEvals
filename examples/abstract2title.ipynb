      "Prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'please write an title based on this abstract of article: '}, {'role': 'system', 'content': 'In the inverted p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the widely-used hole transporting layer (HTL) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) induce degradation problems and hysteresis. To address this issue, several attempts are explored on film formation and interface engineering to improve efficiency. Here, adding alanine into pristine PEDOT:PSS proved beneficial to reconstruct the distribution of the -SO3- and -SO3H groups, resulting an improvement of the charge collection and transport owing to the weakened enrichment of -SO3H. The conductivities of reconstructed PEDOT:PSS films were improved as well as an enhancement of the hydrophobicity.

The devices with P3HT exhibit a substantial increase in power conversion efficiency, open circuit voltage, and fill factor, compared with the reference device without P3HT. Impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the present P3HT layer decreases the internal resistance in solar cells and allows the interface between oriented TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx to form more perfect in electronics. It is also found that the electron lifetime in the devices with P3HT is much longer than that of the device without P3HT.
