First, the energy release rate of the mold film is controlled successfully for an efficient transfer process, which was confirmed by contact angle measurements compared to the normal PUA. The transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits comparable smoothness, and also induces the favorable crystallinity of perovskite related to the spin-coated layer, which shows similar JSC and PCE (spin-coated compared to transfer printing: 12.85% compared to 12.33%), and improved VOC. The effects of the device electrical parameters are analyzed in detail by PL mapping, charge carrier mobility, and impedance response. Furthermore, the stability of the device with transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS achieved 90% retention for approximately 40\u202fdays, which was affected by the preserved crystallinity of perovskite, and the inhibition of the degradation of ITO from XRD and XPS analyses, respectively.

N-O emission system is observed in the plasma during the treatment, indicating the reactions of reactive nitrogen plasma species with the organics in the precursor films. Long DBD treatment duration (60\u202fs) leads to the phase precipitation of PbI2 and degrades the cell efficiency, whereas short DBD treatment duration (20\u202fs) significantly improves the PSC efficiency by nearly 40%. Only slight performance enhancement is observed in the PSCs prepared by conventional thermal treatment at the same substrate temperatures as that for DBD treatment, implying that DBD provides the synergetic effect of the reactivity and plasma heating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicates that the charge recombination impedance increases and then decreases with DBD treatment duration. The shunt resistance also shows a similar trend, and it is consistent with the PSC performance. The PSC with the 20\u202fs DBD-treated absorber layer shows energy conversion efficiency of 14.29%, open circuit voltage of 1.022\u202fV, short circuit current density of 19.45\u202fmA/cm2, and fill factor of 0.72, whereas the corresponding values for the untreated counterpart are 10.32%, 0.976\u202fV, 18.52\u202fmA/cm2, and 0.57.

By employing CuS combined with two different perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and (FAPbI3)0.78(MAPbBr3)0.14(CsPbI3)0.08 (CsFAMAPbIBr), very high current densities and fill-factors are observed, suggesting an effective hole-extraction happening at the CuS interface.

As a remark, such PCE values are only limited by a reduced open-circuit voltage around 0.8\u202fV, due to different phenomena occurring at perovkite/CuS interface such as an increased non-radiative recombination, caused by considerable difference in valence band value, and the effect of CuS metallic character.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that a change in the Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio of NiO (Ni 2p at 854.0\u202feV) and the presence of Ni3+ species induced by vacancies in Ni2O3 (Ni 2p at 855.6\u202feV) and NiOOH (Ni 2p at 856.7\u202feV) were responsible for the enhanced conductivity of the two-step-annealed NiOx films.

Besides, the pre-heat treatment of PCBM solution exhibits a better covered area over CH3NH3PbI3 layer with reduced pinhole compared with the non-heat treatment. This can be explained by the higher thermal energy PCBM molecules of the pre-heat solution leading to higher molecule mobility that can reorganizes a structural as well as enhance the diffusion and enhance coverage of PCBM films over CH3NH3PbI3. The optimized cell is enhanced with average power conversion efficiency from 4.59% up to 5.76% (6.44% maximum) by heat treatment. To investigate interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM, the contact angle was measured and found that the contact angle of PCBM films were higher after heat treatment suggesting re-alignment and better orientation of PCBM on perovskite film. The better orientation of PCBM can be explained in term of hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of the interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM. These results suggest that pre-heat treatment of PCBM solution has ability to modify the interface for better orientation of PCBM and resulting in efficiency enhancement due to better carrier transport direction at the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM interfaces for perovskite solar cells. In addition, the better orientation that the head (non-polar)is oriented at outer surface can also prevent the solar cells from surrounding moisture.",

Polythiophenes are a promising class of hole-transport layer (HTL) materials that could satisfy these requirements. However, PSCs fabricated using conventional poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) HTLs show limited efficiencies of <16% owing to the shallow highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and poor charge extraction ability of P3HT. Herein, we demonstrate that the fluorinated polythiophene derivative FEH is a suitable replacement for P3HT and a promising HTL material for perovskite solar cells. The FEH was found to have a deeper HOMO and exhibit more efficient charge-extraction ability at the perovskite/HTL interface than P3HT. This is attributed to the electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine atoms in FEH and its ability to form more uniform films on the perovskite layer. Thus, when FEH was employed as the HTL, the corresponding PSC showed an improved efficiency of 18.0% and an enhancement of all device parameters compared with control devices fabricated using P3HT (10.8%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (17.0%) HTLs. Moreover, fluorination on the conjugated backbone of the polymer increases its hydrophobicity, and the resulting hydrophobic surface of the FEH HTL prevents the ingress of water, resulting in an improvement of the long-term stability of the corresponding PSCs under air exposure.",

With the introduction of FAI, Cubic: Column composite structure of (FA)x(MA)1-xPbI3 was formed on the top of mesoscopic TiO2. This nanostructure not only leads to fully coverage of perovskite on TiO2 but also provides salutary electron transport channels to effectively reduce the electron recombination probability. As a result, optimal solar cell efficiency of 13.03% of (FA)x(MA)1-xPbI3 composite structure based PSC (when x is fixed at 0.25) was achieved, while PSC based typical MAPbI3 cuboids only obtained an efficiency of 12.49%. Despite of the improved efficiency, the Cubic: Column composite structure caused by the addition of FAI also contributes to higher long-term and thermal stability.",

        "abstract": "Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have attracted tremendous attention recently because of their excellent photovoltaic performance. Simultaneously achieving high performance and long-term stability mainly relies on improving the quality of the perovskite film and overcoming the interface losses through interface engineering. Here, we demonstrate a high performance ITO/CuSCN-based planar heterojunction pero-SCs using solution-processable perylene\u2212diimide derivative PDINO as cathode buffer layer. The device showed a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05V, a hysteresis-free photovoltaic response and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4%. The high performance can be ascribed to the proper choice of the anode and cathode interface materials. In comparison with the commonly used PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer, the CuSCN anode buffer layer can increase the built-in potential and decrease the interfacial energy barrier with CH3NH3PbI3, which results in higher Voc. The thickness-insensitive PDINO cathode buffer layer is beneficial to higher short circuit current density. The results indicate that the combination of the CuSCN anode buffer layer and PDINO cathode buffer layer is an effective way to get high photovoltaic performance of the p-i-n planar pero-SCs.",

The ordered hier-TiO2 nanostructures were scattered on compact TiO2 layer to form a quasi-mesoscopic scaffold of scattered distribution, which can offer enough growth space for perovskite grains and promote the ordered growth of perovskite grains.

The PCEs of PSCs with hier-TiO2 and npt-TiO2 remain 47% and 22% of the initial PCE values aging for 30days in air, indicating that PSCs with hier-TiO2 scaffold shown better stability and moisture resistance. The enhanced performance of QM-PSCs is primarily attributed to the superior wettability quasi-mesoscopic scaffold with ordered porous hier-TiO2 nanostructures, which help to form the high quality perovskite film with better crystillinity and less pin-holes, and improve the contact properties between perovksite and electron transport layer.",

The dimensionality of (C6H5CH2NH2)(CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 is controlled using the exposure time to the CH3NH3I vapor on the C6H5CH2NH3PbI4 perovskite film.

Furthermore, the devices have a smaller band gap, which offers broader absorption and the potential to increase the photocurrent density in the solar cell. As a result, the photovoltaic device based on the (C6H5CH2NH2)(CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 perovskite exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 5.43% with a short circuit current density of 14.49mAcm\u22122, an open circuit voltage of 0.85V, and a fill factor of 44.30 for the best power conversion efficiency under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100mWcm\u22122), which is significantly higher than the 0.34% of the pure two-dimensional BAPbI4 perovskite-based solar cell.",

In the PSC device, hole transporting material (HTM) is a crucial component to efficiently extract and collect photoinduced charges. In this study, two novel dithiafulvenyl-based small molecules are designed and synthesized as HTMs for PSCs. The only difference of the two HTMs is that replacing phenothiazine in LHTM-1 with carbazole to construct LHTM-2, aiming to study the influences of the minor structural discrepancy on the photovoltaic performance. It shows that the molecular structure change from phenothiazine to carbazole significantly improves the molecular planarity, hole mobility and shifted the highest occupied molecular orbital level downward. Consequently, comparing with LHTM-1, CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC employing carbazole-based LHTM-2 as HTM achieves higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.81%, which is comparable to Spiro-OMeTAD-based device (PCE=16.07%).

Furthermore, a dramatically longer annealing time (usually 100\u202fmin) is required for these films (3:0:1) due to the slow formation of the MAPbI3 phase via MACl loss, which is not conducive to perovskite film formation under ambient conditions due to perovskite degradation upon long exposure to moisture. Pure MAPbI3 films can be formed very rapidly from (1:1:0) (MAI:PbI2:PbCl2\u202f=\u202f1 : 1: 0) solution within a short annealing time, but they show small grain sizes and poor film quality.

        "abstract": "Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are a promising candidate for fabricating high-efficiency solar cells. In this work, well-dispersed ternary oxide BaSnO3 (BSO) nanoparticles with high crystallinity were successfully synthesized by a facile peroxide-precipitate route. And then BSO was first used as an efficient electron-transporting layer in planar perovskite solar cells. Influences of the coverage, roughness and thickness of planar BSO layer on the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells were systemically investigated. It is found that better coverage of BSO layer on the transparent oxide electrodes can significant reduce current leakage and suitable thickness of electron-transporting layer is favorable to reduce series resistance. Both of them contribute to the improved power conversion efficiency of cell devices. Additionally, the BSO-based device exhibits a comparable device performances to the TiO2 one, which can be ascribed to the efficient charge extraction as BSO/perovskite interfaces, the low charge transfer resistance and the suppressed carrier recombination. The optimized BSO-based planar perovskite solar cells exhibits power conversion efficiency of 10.96% with Jsc of 17.45\u00a0mA/cm2, Voc of 0.986\u00a0V and FF of 0.637.

Thus, the efficiency of cell fabricated by CVD method was 7.9%, which is improved by 29.5% as compared with cells using the conventional spin-coating method. Furthermore, the cell fabricated by CVD method gave an excellent stability. Accordingly, the efficiency was lost only 17% after 500\u202fh performances.

It is found that the performance of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with CZTS film as hole transporting material (HTM) strongly depends on CZTS thickness due to that its absorption of photons significantly limits the photon-to-electron transfer below 550\u202fnm, and the CZTS film thinner than 100\u202fnm is a more effective HTM for efficient MAPbI3-based solar cells; furthermore, the CZTS/MAPbI3 solar cells are much more efficient and stable than the counterpart devices with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) as HTM.",

To enhance the device stability, a new poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):sulfonated acetone-formaldehyde (PEDOT:SAF) with higher PEDOT content (2:1) is developed considering the excellent dispersing capacity of SAF. PEDOT:SAF exhibits extremely lower acidity with pH value of 6 and higher conductivity of 3.12\u00a0S/cm comparing with the former reported sample with lower PEDOT content. Moreover, PEDOT:SAF film shows superior ultraviolet (UV) absorptivity originated from the fluorescence effect of SAF and unexceptionable film waterproofness on account of the high PEDOT content. As a result, the PSC incorporating PEDOT:SAF as the hole extraction layer (HEL) achieves higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and highly enhanced device stability than the traditional PEDOT:PSS-based device. After 28 days of storage time, our device retains 83.2% from its original PCE, while almost half-degradation is experienced in the PEDOT:PSS controlled device.

Unlike typically reported upconverting nanoparticles with narrow NIR absorption, the as-prepared IR806-UCNCs are able to harvest NIR light broadly and then transfer the captured energy to the UCNCs for an efficient visible upconversion. The IR806-UCNCs-incorporated cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 17.49%, corresponding to 29% increment from that of the pristine cell (13.52%).

Of the solution-processable interlayer candidates, NiOx is considered one of the best inorganic hole-transporting layer (HTL) materials. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NiOx-based PSCs are limited by the unfavorable contact between perovskite layers and NiOx HTLs, the high density of surface trap sites, and the inefficient charge extraction from perovskite photoactive layers to anodes. Here, we introduce a new organic-inorganic double HTL consisting of a Cu:NiOx thin film passivated by a conjugated polyelectrolyte (PhNa-1T) film. This double HTL has a significantly lower pinhole density and forms better contact with perovskite films, which results in enhanced charge extraction. As a result, the PCEs of PSCs fabricated with the double HTL are impressively improved up to 17.0%, which is more than 25% higher than that of the corresponding PSC with a Cu:NiOx HTL. Moreover, PSCs with the double HTLs exhibit similar stabilities under ambient conditions to devices using inorganic Cu:NiOx.

Consequently, the perovskite solar cell based on the rare-earth doped upconversion nanoparticle mesoporous layer achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 20.19%, while the device based on TiO2 mesoporous layer gets an efficiency of 17.44%.",

However, most perovskite solar cells have been fabricated by lab-scale spin-coating method and the strategy for the doctor-bladed device improvement is quite limited. In this study, we report an additive-assisted strategy enabled by Poly(acrylic acid) molecular doping to connect wide gaps between the large domains and passivate defects in the bladed perovskite film. Using this strategy, we obtain a smooth, uniform, and pin-hole free doctor-bladed perovskite film of high electronical quality, which are proved by detailed laser spectroscopy. Consequently, the P-i-N planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with these bladed thin films achieve considerable enhancement of power conversion efficiency from 10.3% to 14.9% compared to the control device.

The optical transparency and electric properties of DMD and its role as a top electrode of PSCs were studied by changing the thickness of the MoOx layer. Although the MoOx thickness was shown to have a negligible effect on the sheet resistance of DMD, the transmittance of visible light, selective carrier transport capability, and long-term stability of a device considerably depend on this factor. The sandwich structure of a 20-nm-thick MoOx, 7-nm-thick Ag, and 20-nm-thick MoOx exhibits a high transmittance and large photon\u2013electron conversion rate of PSCs. In addition, PSCs using the DMD top electrode maintain 92% of their initial current density after 24\u202fh of continuous operation owing to a UV light cut-off of the top illumination. Moreover, the overall structure of DMD blocks the diffusion of water and oxygen molecules from real environmental conditions. At the same time, the underlying/upper MoOx layer retards the degradation through a chemical reaction between Ag and the halide ions inside the cells, as well as foreign ions from outside the polluted atmosphere. When DMD is applied to flexible PSCs on Ti foil, the PCE reaches 14.5%, and mechanical integrity of the PSCs is maintained at a bending radius of 4\u202fmm.",

        "abstract": "Developing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high-efficiency and a low-temperature process has great potential for the realization of the scalable, economic, and roll-to-roll based renewable energy conversion devices. ZnO has been recognized as the promising electron transport layer (ETL) that may overcome the limitations of the conventional TiO2. However, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite is prone to decomposition at the ZnO surface, which hinders the development of simple one-step deposition of perovskite, resulting in the limited photovoltaic performance. Herein, we report interlayer mediated efficient ETLs for viable flexible PSCs. The utilization of polyethyleneimine ethoxylated layer on ZnO prevents the direct contact between the perovskite and ETLs, avoiding the photoactive layer decomposition. Thus, interlayer-mediated PSCs show higher efficiency with enhanced stability by decreasing the electron transport barrier. As a result, the PSC employing tailor-designed ETL interfaces exhibited average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8%, which was superior by 25.4% to that of a control device (12.6%). With our strategy, we further demonstrated PSCs on flexible substrates which exhibit an average PCE of 11.9% under low-temperature fabrication. The new interface engineering strategy may pave the way to the realization of high performance, easy-to-process, and large-area perovskite optoelectronics.",

Under the similar content of PbI2, the efficiency of the device based ZnO layers by ultraviolet ozone treatment for 20\u202fmin is not only three times of the device without treatment, but superior to that of the device based ZnO layers by annealing at 300\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh.

The effect of a series of ligand vapours including ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA) and triethylenetetramine (TETA) was systematically investigated. A thin hydrophobic two-dimensional (2D) perovskite capping layer formed in the device after the 3D perovskite was exposed to the vapour of long chain ethylene-amine molecules, such as DETA and TETA, which protected the underlying bulk 3D perovskite layer from moisture attack. An improved energy level alignment was obtained in the treated devices and that a reduced density of defects was present in the perovskite after treatment with DETA and TETA vapours. Consequently, enhanced efficiency from 17.07% to 18.09% (DETA) and improved moisture stability with PCE retention from 73.8% to 90.0% (TETA) under a relative humidity>65% for 1000\u00a0h were achieved by this vapour treatment respectively.",

To understand the aging effects in PSCs is mandatory to rationally design implemented architectures and materials combining a viable deposition process, efficiency and stability. Despite of this evidence, only few experimental works succeeded in the direct quantitative characterization of aging effects in PSCs. In this work, we apply state-of-the-art X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile analysis and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) 3D imaging to investigate the light-induced degradation of layers and interfaces in reference (Au/Spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/cTiO2/FTO) and interface-engineered mesoscopic PSCs in which graphene flakes are added into the mesoscopic TiO2 layer and a solution-processed 2H-MoS2 flakes buffer layer is added at the Spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. Results show that the graphene addition into the mesoscopic TiO2 layer improves the stability of the PSC by reducing the locally-inhomogeneous light-induced back-conversion of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer into PbIx and PbOx species and the consequent release of iodine species, which diffuse across the interfaces and causes the modifications at the gold electrode (Au-I bonding) and the mesoscopic TiO2 (Ti-I bonding) interfaces. Moreover, where the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is preserved the gold diffusion across the entire device structure is strongly reduced even after the aging. The 2H-MoS2 flakes buffer layer allows limiting the localized diffusion of gold and the iodine diffusion in as-prepared PSCs while it is rather ineffective in preventing light-induced aging effects. Overall, thanks to the lower average degradation of the layers and interfaces, interface engineered PSCs could retain \u223c60% of their initial PCE after the aging respect to less than \u223c25% in the reference cells.",

        "abstract": "ZnO as electron extraction layer in photovoltaic devices has many advantages, including high mobility and low processing temperature. However, it has been underutilized in perovskite solar cells due to the reported instabilities of perovskite layers deposited on ZnO resulting in poor device performance. Herein, we modify the ZnO layer by incorporating Cs or Li dopants in its bulk and depositing a self-assembled monolayer on its surface. This combined approach of engineering both the bulk and surface properties of ZnO results in significant improvements in the performance of planar MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 18%, accompanied by a reduction in hysteresis and a significant enhancement of the device stability. Our work makes engineered solution-processed ZnO layers a practical alternative to TiO2 as electron extraction layers in perovskite solar cells, while also eliminating the need for high temperature sintering steps from the device fabrication.",

        "abstract": "In fabrication of SnO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) via traditional solution routes, the strong dependence of film crystallization on high temperature annealing or robust thermal treatment makes it challengeable to prepare crystallized SnO2 ETLs at low temperature (< 150\u00b0C). Here, we put forward a sol-gel route by which the whole fabrication process of crystallized SnO2 ETL below 80\u00b0C is realized for the first time. In the new route, participation of atmosphere O2 and H2O by refluxing is crucial as it can greatly promote Sn2+ oxidation and controlled hydrolysis in SnCl2\u00b72H2O alcohol solution, in turn opening up an energetically favorable pathway for SnO2 crystallization at low temperature. Systematical investigations reveal that SnO2 ETLs have high conductivity and transmittance and appropriate energy band level, by which PSCs obtain superior photovoltaic performance, with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) and steady-state PCE of 19.20% and 18.48% achieved, respectively, much higher than that of the devices using high temperature annealed TiO2 ETLs (16.61% and 15.03%). The SnO2-ETL-based flexible PSCs also attain a high PCE up to 16.11% and among the highest records of flexible PSCs. Due to a larger band gap, SnO2-ETLs-based PSCs show superior UV resistance against high intensity UV light irradiation.",

        "abstract": "The solvent treatment of the perovskite surfaces has been popularly applied to enhance the device performance of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and become the most useful method for fully solution-processed devices. However, the simple solvent engineering cannot address all interfacial contact problems in the traditionally-structured perovskite devices, limiting the applicability of solution processing. Here, we introduce a universal solvent engineering technology, termed sequential solvent processing with hole transport materials (HTMs), which can be used to fabricate high efficient traditionally-structured PSCs. Our new approach induces interdiffusion between the perovskite and HTM layers, which improves their interfacial contacts, by dripping a chlorobenzene solution of the HTM onto a perovskite precursor before the perovskite crystallization is complete, thereby enabling the HTM to penetrate into the perovskite layer. Furthermore, the approach enhances the quality of the perovskite crystals, improves interfacial energy band alignment, and densifies the interface, which are advantageous for carrier extraction from the perovskite layer to the HTM. Our simple and effective strategy achieves power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.39% with 22.6% increment, compared to the control device (PCE = 15.00%). Overall, this approach is a significant improvement over the existing fabrication methods and proves to be an importantly new method for future research on PSCs.",

Up to 19.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved. Especially, the PSCs exhibit superior stability in ambient condition, which PCE can be retained 95% of its initial PCE after 1200h. Further investigation suggests that the residual CPL in the perovskite film can well passivate perovskite grain boundaries and the interface by its interaction with Pb2+ cations, thus leading to good anti-moisture and thermal stabilities of perovskite films.

However, before commercializing, the problems regarding to the environmental stability and electrical hysteresis of PSCs still need to be tackled. We present a simple route by stacking n-type materials TiO2 (spray pyrolysis) and SnO2 (aqueous colloidal) for planar devices, and achieve a stable (~91% efficiency >90 days at 30%RH without encapsulation), hysteresis-free (hysteresis index 0.004) and efficient (18.03%) perovskite solar cells. Moreover, we carry out a system stability evaluation for unsealed devices under harsh conditions with intense UV illumination, heat and damp in an environmental chamber. Both TiO2 and SnO2 devices demonstrate inferior performance compare to the stacked samples in the accelerated stability tests. Photoluminescence, phase and electrical characterizations suggest that the performance enhancement is ascribed to the synergetic optimization from concealing the defective interface and promotion of carriers transfer and blocking. With the optimized n-type layers, a high efficiency of 14.39% is obtained for the 5 \u00d7 5cm2 sub-module.

Herein, we report a novel anti-solvent washing treatment simply using Hydrogen Iodide (HI) additive in chlorobenzene (CB) which can enormously improve CH3NH3PbI3 films surface with high crystallization phase purity and chemical homogeneity, leading to excellent structural stability under humidity, heat and even tensile force.

Moreover, fabricated flexible planar PSCs on PET/ITO substrates with a champion PCE of 17.32% are shown to be more robust under tensile force than their control devices. The present study thus not only provides more insight into the facile defects passivation process on the surface achieved via balancing halide ions, but also provides a practical but efficient treatment which can be widely used to fabricate high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films for environmentally stable high performance device applications.",

In samples annealed at a moderate temperature (100\u202f\u00b0C), a small amount of expelled PbI2 passivates the grain boundaries and improves photocurrent generation. A higher annealing temperature (130\u202f\u00b0C) causes further segregation of PbI2 at grain boundaries, decreasing the photocurrent.

Herein, we have proposed a low-temperature (70\u202f\u00b0C) chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with different time to prepare In2S3 films as the ETL of IPSCs.

This advance enables an increase in the Voc of the inverted perovskite solar cells from an initial 1.12\u202fV to 1.24\u202fV. With the optimization of the device fabrication process, the champion inverted wide-bandgap cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 18.19% and sustains more than 72% of its initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 70\u202fh without encapsulation. Additionally, a semitransparent device with an indium tin oxide back contact retains more than 88% of its initial efficiency after 100\u202fh maximum power point tracking.",

        "abstract": "Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cell researches have been extensively conducted due to its unprecedentedly excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which are reported to be over 23.7% in maximum. Despite the high PCEs, there are several unresolved issues on optimal interface states in the cell and device stabilities. Moreover, beyond the simple PV device issues, extended device or circuit applications have rarely been reported although it seems equally important to fully reveal the self-power energy harvesting functions of the perovskite cells to modern ubiquitous environment. Here, we integrate a realistic self-power circuit utilizing a few nm-thin molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) field effect transistors (FETs) as well as perovskite PV cells. The PV cells intrinsically show more than 0.9\u202fV of open circuit voltage (VOC) under artificial sun (AM 1.5) or visible photon illumination, so we thus used a red-light emitting diode (LED) to simply generate ~1\u202fV of photovoltage. Two modes for practical operation were consequently observed from the circuit, depending on the light intensity: self-power current/voltage source mode (high intensity) and photosensor mode (low intensity). We now conclude that our self-power circuit approaches integrating perovskite cells and 2D MoTe2 FET could attract much attention for future ubiquitous electronics and energy harvest applications.",

        "abstract": "Graphene has shown many advantages over the metal oxide transparent materials that serve as conventional electrodes in solar cells because graphene is more transparent, has greater stability, and is more mechanically flexible. Flexibility and semi-transparency of the perovskite solar cells are challenged to integrate with the flexible electronic devices since the perovskite solar cells have discovered. Herein, we provide the first report of transfer-free, large-scale monolayer graphene employed as a transparent and flexible bottom electrode. High-quality graphene without transfer process was directly synthesized at 150\u202f\u00b0C on a polymer substrate via plasma assisted thermal chemical vapor deposition (PATCVD). Additionally, a highly transparent AZO/Ag/AZO (AAA) multilayer was utilized as a top counter electrode to create semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with a remarkable degree of mechanical flexibility. The 300\u202fnm-thick perovskite solar cells with PATCVD-Graphene revealed a high transmittance of ~26% at a wavelength of 700\u202fnm. The highest level of power conversion efficiency (PCE) (~14.2%) was recorded by an illumination from the bottom graphene side. After 1000 bending cycles under a tensile strain of 1.5%, the graphene-based devices maintained a level of PCE that was more than 90% greater than the initial reading. This superior bending robustness highlights the potential for non-transfer, graphene-based, perovskite photovoltaic material to establish a tandem structure for a foldable solar cell.",

This is achieved by improving the cubic-phase-stabilization and electronic-coupling in CsPbI3-PQD solids. In conventional approaches, the hydrolysis of methyl acetate (MeOAc) resulting in acetic acid and methanol as intermediate substances plays a key role in replacing long-chain hydrocarbons with short-chain ligands, which improves charge transport in the CsPbI3-PQD solids. However, CsPbI3-PQDs suffer from lattice distortion and instability under acidic conditions including protons and polar media, leading to CsPbI3-PQD fusion and poor photovoltaic performance. Herein, we report that electronic coupling and photovoltaic performance of CsPbI3-PQD solids are improved by efficient removal of long-chain oleate ligands using a solution of sodium acetate (NaOAc) in MeOAc, which results in the direct generation of OAc ions without forming protons and methanol. NaOAc-based ligand exchange of CsPbI3-PQDs enables preservation of their nanocrystal size without fusion and minimization of surface trap states originating from metal hydroxide formation on their surfaces. Consequently, the best solar cell comprising NaOAc-treated CsPbI3-PQDs shows an improved device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3%, as compared with a lead nitrate-treated control device (12.4% PCE).",

However, unavoidable defects near the perovskite surface seriously hampers carrier transport and easily results in ion accumulation at the interface of perovskite layer and charge transport layer. Herein, delocalized thiazole and imidazole derivatives iodide salts functionalized on perovskite surface have been investigated comprehensively. These two salts post-treatment on perovskite could efficiently passivate traps arising from Cs+ or I\u2212 vacancies. Additionally, these highly \u043f-conjugated delocalized molecules can contribute to the efficient charge transport and prevent ions accumulation at the interface. As a result, sulfur-contained aminothiazolium iodide (ATI) post-treated CsPbI2Br devices showed simultaneous enhanced current density and voltage due to its higher interaction with perovskite lattice, this led to a champion efficiency of 13.91% with superb fill factor of more than 80%, which exhibited dramatic enhancement compared with the control samples (10.12%). Furthermore, surface passivation with delocalized molecules could effectively stabilize CsPbI2Br phase at room temperature or 80\u202f\u00b0C annealing in ambient condition (65% RH). Equally important, this surface passivation allowed competitive efficiency of 11.26% with a large-area device (1.00\u202fcm2).

The fabrication of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) strictly requires the fabrication temperature below 150\u00a0\u00b0C due to the limitation of flexible substrate. For retaining the process at low temperature, applying anti-solvents has becoming to the most popular method. However, the involvement of anti-solvents requires very precise control and brings toxicity in the fabrication procedures, which limits its large-scale industrial use. Here, we propose a strategy that simply replacing the usual anti-solvents with CH3NH3Br (CH3NH3+, MA) into dynamic spinning of perovskite precursor significantly reduces the formation energy of \u03b1-phase FA-perovskites to 40\u00a0\u00b0C. An optimized annealing temperature at 100\u00a0\u00b0C provides high-quality morphology and crystallization of FA-based perovskite films with superior optoelectric properties, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of flexible PSCs to 18.5% and retaining over 80% of its initial PCE after 1200 bending cycles. This is the best performance so far of preparing anti-solvent free flexible PSCs at low temperature (\u2264100\u00a0\u00b0C).

To address these issues, a simple strategy by applying phenethylammonium halides to reduce the energy loss and suppress the phase segregation of wide-bandgap PVSCs is developed.

Therefore, we investigated the impacts of perovskite solution temperatures on charge carrier dynamics of perovskite film and perovskite solar cell performance that were quantitatively analyzed using steady-state photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved emission spectra (TRES), excitation-dependence of PL and current-voltage measurements. It is found that the perovskite solution temperature greatly influenced the morphologies, defect densities and states, and charge recombination dynamics of perovskite thin films. Particularly, steady-state and time-resoled PL measurements revealed that perovskite thin films prepared with the perovskite solution temperature around 70\u00a0\u00b0C produced lowest surface and bulk defect densities. In addition, it is found that the perovskite solution temperature around 70\u00a0\u00b0C led to exciton-like transitions while lower and higher solution temperatures led to defect-mediated recombination of perovskite thin films. Such recombination dynamics of perovskite films strongly influenced the light absorption and extraction efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers which in turn influenced short-circuit current, fill factor, and open circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. As a result, better photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells was observed when prepared with the precursor temperature around 70\u00a0\u00b0C.",

However, PEDOT:PSS-based devices suffer a lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) than devices with the conventional structure. To address this issue, we fabricated ammonia-modified PEDOT:PSS films by simply doping PEDOT:PSS solution with different ratio of ammonia. The acidity of PEDOT:PSS can be neutralized by the doped ammonia, which inhibits the ion-exchange reaction between PSS-H and CH3NH3I, thus retarding the reduction of the work function for PEDOT:PSS to some extent. As a result, a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.5% was obtained for the device based on the ammonia-doped PEDOT:PSS HTL than that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS-based device. We ascribe the PCE enhancement to the increased Voc and fill factor (FF), which is attributed not only to the better energy-level alignment between the ammonia-modified PEDOT:PSS film and perovskite layer but also to the increased grain size and crystallinity of perovskite film.",

However, the morphology of perovskite film fabricated through two-step sequential deposition method usually suffers from poor film coverage and low crystallinity due to the ungovernable crystallization kinetics. Moreover, owing to the compact stacking of PbI2 crystals, the conversion of PbI2 is incomplete as well. In this work, we propose for the first time to control the nanostructure of PbI2 to get high crystallinity, identical (100) crystal orientation and PbI2 residue-free film. Porous PbI2 with plate structure was obtained by selected solvent annealing (SSA). The reaction rate between PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI) was accelerated because the contact area between PbI2 and MAI was enlarged due to the porous nanostructure of PbI2. Thus, uniform, high crystalline perovskite film without PbI2 residue was obtained. Furthermore, (100) crystal orientation of perovskite was obtained due to the PbI2 shape changing from grain to plate, which originated from the changing growth frontier of PbI2 crystals. As a result, a promising power conversion efficiency of 16.61% is achieved in planar-heterojunction PVSCs due to improved photoabsorption and carrier extraction efficiency. This work for the first time establishes the relationship between PbI2 structure and the corresponding structure of perovskite in detail, and shows a reasonable design of PbI2 nanostructure is important to improve the perovskite morphology.",

Further device characterizations, including incident photon-to-current efficiency, UV\u2013vis absorption spectra, photoluminescence and alternating current impedance spectroscopy, suggested that the significant increase of device performance could mainly attribute to better light harvesting by the scattering effect of AuAg ANCs and better charge transport of the modified PEDOT:PSS layer. This study provides a new doping material in PEDOT:PSS to enhance the light harvesting, which leads to a significant improvement on the performance of pero-SCs.",

        "abstract": "The grand challenge involved in inverted organic solar cell (IOSC) and perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology is to control the interfacial losses at the interface of the photoactive layer with the electron extracting electrode. Herein, three organic small molecules, namely o-(F)-PO-TAZ, m-(F)-PO-TAZ and p-(F)-PO-TAZ, consisting of phosphine oxide (PO) functionalized 1,3,5-triazine (TAZ) with a fluorine atom (F) at the ortho (o)/meta (m)/para (p) positions of the phenoxy group attached to the TAZ unit are developed via a rational design approach and used as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) in flexible IOSCs and PSCs. We realized that the F position particularly affects the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the PO-TAZ derivatives, which in turn exerts a positive effect by maintaining robust and smooth morphological features. This gives the IOSC and PSC devices an F position-dependent performance. Particularly, ZnO/p-(F)-PO-TAZ-based flexible IOSC and PSC devices display not only high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.68% and 14.64% but also long-term stability that are superior to those of the control and o-(F)- and m-(F)-PO-TAZ-based solar cell devices.

These high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films are further used to fabricate planar heterojunction (PHJ) PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ag, showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 14.2% with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, these PHJ-PSCs show excellent stability, and over 80% of their original efficiencies could be maintained even stored in air (humidity \u223c45%) for 20 days without encapsulation. Meanwhile, the PCE up to 13.6% could be achieved for PHJ-PSCs fully fabricated in air including electron transport layer PCBM.

        "abstract": "For perovskite solar cells, thermal treatment of perovskite/PCBM layer is typically required for facilitated charge extraction, thereby eliminating the notorious photocurrent hysteresis. However, a simple manufacturing process without additional heat treatment is desirable for low-cost production. Remarkably, we observed an absence of photocurrent hysteresis of perovskite solar cell with as-deposited PCBM/C60 layer. To understand what caused hysteresis-free photocurrent behaviors, PL quenching studies were conducted using time-resolved lifetime decays and deconvoluted PL analysis. It is found that the perovskite/PCBM layer, which was not thermally treated after deposition, led to inefficient defect passivation of grain boundaries (GBs) and defective domains at the perovskite interface. This led to charge trapping and detrapping events at the perovskite/PCBM interface, which caused the photocurrent hysteresis behaviors. In contrast, it is found that C60 diffused from the PCBM/C60 layer effectively passivated the perovskite GBs even without thermal treatment, which facilitated the charge transfer through GBs to electrodes and eliminated the photocurrent hysteresis. Our result provides a more economical manufacturing process without heat treatment of perovskite/PCBM layer while achieving defect passivation and high charge extraction efficiency of perovskite solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Plasmon enhanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporated with AgAl and Au composite nanoparticles (NPs) isolating from AgAl metal electrode with ultra-thin LiF spacer were investigated. PSCs with AgAl-Au composite NPs got 17.02% of the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is 11.10% higher than PCE (15.32%) of the control PSC with only AgAl electrode. Furthermore, the hysteresis effect of PSCs with LiF modified AgAl and Au composite NPs can be neglected compared to the control cells without NPs and LiF spacer. In the meanwhile, carrier transport and collection probabilities of PSCs with AgAl and Au composite NPs were increased to 96.86% from 89.51% in control cells, indicating the improved electron transport and extraction ability. The enhanced PCEs of PSCs with AgAl(3\u202fnm)/Au(2\u202fnm)/LiF(1\u202fnm) are attributed to the improved light absorption of perovskite layer and the reduced contact barrier at metal electrode, which can be supported with its enhanced photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (\u25b3IPCE) and the disappeared negative capacitive behavior. Furthermore, the obviously reduced work function values of AgAl-Au composite NPs and AgAl metal electrode after LiF modification were observed with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy spectra. Our results indicate that thermally evaporating a ultra-thin LiF spacer can well inhibit the energy dissipation of plasmon effects of AgAl-Au composite NPs and reduce the contact barrier between PCBM and AgAl metal electrode, which is an efficient strategy to achieve efficient plasmon-enhanced perovskite solar cells.",

        "abstract": "The morphology of perovskite film plays a key role in determining photoabsorption, carrier transport and ambient stability in perovskite solar cells. However, due to the fast crystallization kinetics, the perovskite film fabricated by solution-processing technique usually suffers from low crystallinity and poor orientation. Here, both the morphology and the ambient stability of perovskite films were improved through regulating crystallization rate and enhancing intermolecular interaction by adding \u03b1, \u03c9-diamino poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2) into precursor solution (mixture of CH3NH3I and PbCl2). The PEG-NH2 and Pb2+ tended to form a new chelated compound Pb2+-PEG-NH2. The stable multidentate chelation between Pb2+ and PEG-NH2 retarded the crystal growth rate to half of the one of the film without PEG-NH2, which is determined by the in situ UV\u2013vis absorption spectra and in situ two-dimensional detection capability. The slow crystallization process is beneficial for realizing an uniform perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity almost 3 times of the pristine film, and increased crystal size from smaller than 100\u202fnm to larger than 300\u202fnm. In addition, the content of perovskite crystals adopted (h 0 0) orientation increased from 9.59% to 20.70% due to the flexible PEG-NH2 chains. Moreover, the ambient stability of perovskite films was also enhanced because the Pb-halogen bond in perovskite crystals became stronger as well as the film became defect-free. As a result, the device fabricated with PEG-NH2 attained a high efficiency of 15.6% with remarkably prolonged ambient stability without encapsulation. This work demonstrates that introducing the polymer that can coordinate to Pb2+ is a feasible way to simultaneously enhance both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.",

High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability of PSCs mainly rely on high crystalline quality of perovskite film, good interface contact between functional layers and matching energy level alignment, which can be achieved by crystal growth regulation and interface engineering. Here, we demonstrate a high-performance planar heterojunction PSCs with PCBM/N2200 as double electron transport layers (ETLs). The N2200-based PSCs exhibit an average PCE of 15.50%, which obviously surpass the average PCE of 14.18% of conventional PSCs with only PCBM as ETLs. In comparison with the conventional PSCs, the PCBM/N2200 double ETLs increase built-in potential of devices and decrease interfacial energy barrier of MAPbI3/PCBM and then result in higher Voc. Moreover, non-fullerene material N2200 can efficiently inhibit the aggregation of PC61BM, promote perovskite surface grain growth and passivate perovskite interface defect. All these are beneficial for electron transfer and extraction, and thereby increase the short-circuit current (Jsc) and the Fill Factor (FF) of N2200 PSCs. In addition, N2200 obviously improve the air- and illumination-stability of PSCs. These results could stem from the interaction between PbI2 as Lewis acid and N2200 as Lewis base.

To accelerate the degradation process, the PSCs are exposed to concentrated sunlight of 2 suns with different illumination duration under the short-circuited condition. Compared to under the open-circuited condition, the PSCs presented here show a slightly more obvious decrease of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and a more distinct hysteresis with the time of light exposure. We infer that, under the short-circuited condition, the more dramatic migration of ions induced by photocurrents should result in greater ohmic dissipation and more trap states. But the weak degradation effects indicate that the devices still exhibit an unexpected photochemical stability against light exposure. Most importantly, there is a self-healing behavior to partly recover the degradation with the light exposure time of more than 8\u202fh, which can be ascribed to the modification from the Cu electrode and the charge transport layers of PTAA and Bphen.

As a result, the short circuit current density and PCE increased by 32.8% and 34.1%, respectively. Morphological studies show that the incorporated AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 particles can serve as inducers for forming highly smooth quasi-2D perovskite film. Comprehensive studies indicate that AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 can also reduce the series resistance, increase light absorption, induce the photon recycling scheme, and assist exciton dissociation at the interface. The combination of all these helpful effects contributes to the observed PCE improvement of quasi-2D PSCs. Our results provide novel insight into the effect of metallic nanoparticles on the quasi-2D perovskite film and on the performance of quasi-2D PSCs.",

Herein, we report that amphoteric imidazole (IZ) and benzimidazole (BIZ) can act as effective and multifunctional dopants for PC61BM-based ETL. The resultant MAPbI3-xCl3-based PeSCs outperform the devices with pristine PC61BM ETL with power conversion efficiency (PCE) significantly improved from 14.38% to 15.62/16.47%. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrate that IZ and BIZ-doping cause remarkable reduction of ETL surface roughness and significant increase in electrical conductivity of ETL, both of which facilitate the electron transport from perovskite (PVK) and Ag cathode. More importantly, IZ and BIZ as dopants may passivate both Lewis-acid and Lewis-base type defects on the PVK surface due to their amphoteric nature. DFT computations further reveal that BIZ is a better Lewis-base and Lewis-acid than IZ due to its larger \u03c0-conjugation, which thus makes it a superior dopant over IZ. In addition, the PeSCs with PC61BM:BIZ based ETL display enhanced device stability by retarding the I\u2212 anion migration from PVK to Ag cathode.",

However, the instability of perovskite solar cells when exposed to moisture, light, oxygen, UV and temperature remains a key challenge to the commercialization. Among these factors, temperature instability has been a major obstacle to fabricating the long-term operational device. In this study, we tried to explore the effect of perovskite layer and hole transport material on the temperature stability of solar cell at different three temperatures (20, 60 and 85\u00b0C). The thermogravimetric analysis and absorption intensity variation characterization results on the perovskite layer indicated that the perovskite layer is not the main factor that leading to the temperature instability. Furthermore, temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that the temperature has no remarkable effect on the crystal structure of perovskite materials. We also performed an aging test of the device by removing additives from spiro-OMeTAD HTM and the solar cells exhibited an improvement of temperature resistant, but it did not solve the problem of temperature instability. Finally, by using P3HT without additives to replace spiro-OMeTAD as HTM, we achieved the devices which can remain initial PCE after 800\u202fh at 20, 60 and 85\u00b0C and display outstanding temperature resistant.

One of the prerequisites for solution-processed high-quality NiO hole-transporting layers is pre-synthesized highly crystalline NiO nanocrystals (NCs). Here, we use the sophisticated solvothermal method to synthesize highly crystalline NiO NCs. The oleylamine ligands are used to well control the nucleation and growth of NiO NCs and achieve good colloidal stability in toluene, which make for high-quality NiO hole-transporting layers by solution process. The related measurements and analysises reveal that the as-prepared NiO hole-transporting layer shows faster hole extraction, more effectively suppressed recombination and fewer surface trap states than the typical poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) hole-transporting layer, finally contributing to superior photovoltaic performance of the corresponding device.

As realizing higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell is still the most crucial task, a great number of schemes were proposed to minimize the carrier loss by optimizing the electrical properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we focus on another significant aspect that is to minimize the light loss by using an antireflection coating (ARC) component to gain a high PCE for PSC devices. In our scheme, silica nanosphere based ARCs are employed to CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs for enhancing the device efficiency. SiO2 nanosphere based ARCs were grown by spin-coating of an aged silica sol. The microstructure and the thickness of the SiO2 nanosphere based ARC were controlled by changing the spin-coating speed from 400 to 4000\u202frpm. The effect of SiO2 nanosphere based ARCs on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells is systematically investigated. The optimized SiO2 nanosphere ARC coating on cleaned glass substrate exhibited a maximum transmittance of 96.1% at \u03bb\u202f=\u202f550\u202fnm wavelength, and averagely increased the transmittance by about 3.8% in a broadband of 400\u2013800\u202fnm.

Overall, the MAPI modules showed a strongly negative temperature coefficient (TC) for PCE, whereas the FMC modules showed a moderate positive temperature coefficient performance as a function of temperature due to the increase in JSC and FF.

Consequently, PSCs with power conversion efficiencies over 14.5%, an improvement from 11.5% for those with the pristine NiOx-based HTL, have been obtained.

TiO2 nanoparticles showed uniform film coverage, high transparency in the visible region with wide optical bandgap, and high electrical conductivity after systematically optimizing the synthetic reaction time, the thermal annealing temperature, and the concentration of Nb doping. When TiO2 nanoparticle was introduced as an electron-transporting layer through low-temperature deposition process, the perovskite solar cells fabricated in ambient conditions showed high efficiencies of 18.97% and 13.51% on the rigid glass and the flexible plastic substrate, respectively. An impressively high open circuit voltage of 1.17\u202fV and short circuit current density of 22.21\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 were achieved due to the well aligned work function and better electrical conductivity of Nb-doped LT-TiO2 layer. Importantly, solar cells fabricated with TiO2 nanoparticle showed high thermal stability, negligible hysteresis, and reduced charge recombination loss at electron-transporting layer/perovskite interfaces. This study shows that TiO2 nanoparticle can be obtained through the low cost and facile synthesis and has high potential as an electron-transporting layer for low-temperature processable perovskite solar cells.",

High quality ETLs are necessary for preparing efficient planar PSCs because the electron diffusion length is shorter than its hole counterpart in perovskite materials and the planar PSCs have short electrons extracting channels due to the lack of mesoporous layers. Recently, impressive advances in planar PSCs with SnO2 ETLs have been reported due to the perfect characteristics of SnO2 material including suitable energy level, high electron mobility, good transmittance, excellent chemical stability, inactive UV photocatalysis, and so on. Here, we use the doping route to further enhance the quality of SnO2 ETLs. The SnO2 nanocrystals are doped with Y3+ through the typical solvothermal method. The Y dopant leads to more suitable energy level structure and better charge carrier dynamics in the devices than those of the undoped ones. The planar PSCs with Y-SnO2 ETLs achieve a champion efficiency of 20.71% with slight hysteresis, much higher than the undoped ones (18.08%).",

More importantly, the IT-like non-fullerenes show an unparalleled ability in extraction and transportation of photo-generated carrier and the radiation loss is largely inhabited. Benefits from the high quality perovskite film, lower recombination loss and trap passivation, the abnormal hysteresis effect is dramatically suppressed by IT-like non-fullerenes.

The shunt losses in the MPSCs are attributed to the leakage current and the non-geminated recombination losses.

Fully inorganic halide perovskites are still far from the MAPbI3 record power conversion efficiency, but they are significantly more stable. In this work, a significant current increase in the absorbing CsPbBr3 halide perovskite layer is measured by conductive Scanning Probe Microscopy (c-SPM) after thermal ageing without visible structural degradation. Enhanced local photocurrent along grain boundaries and triple junctions is observed by c-SPM. These effects are accompanied by the appearance of downward band bending along grain boundaries as measured by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. It is suggested that the resulting built in electric field effectively acts to facilitate splitting of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at grain boundaries by attracting electrons and repelling holes. The fact of current increase, even though significantly smaller in amplitude, is further confirmed by macroscopic measurements on a complete cell, which may arise from improvement of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbBr3 interfaces upon thermal ageing. These measurements provide advanced understanding of how nanoscale localized structure and function evolve in time and upon thermal ageing. These findings proved further impetus for increasing inorganic halide perovskites power conversion efficiency up to levels sufficient for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Herein, 1,6-Diaminohexane Dihydrochloride (1,6-DD) is introduced into perovskite precursors to fabricate the inverted planar perovskite solar cells. By regulating the concentration of 1,6-DD additive, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 20%. The champion device achieves a relatively high PCE of 17% and an excellent fill factor of 80.1%. The PCE of the large-area (1\u202fcm2) device also reaches to 13.68%. After exposure to the air for 16 days, the device with 1,6-DD additive still retains above 90% of the initial efficiency, exhibiting good stability. We demonstrate that a small amount of 1,6-DD affects the crystallization dynamic, yielding ideal perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity and enlarged grain size. The two terminal -NH3+ groups passivates the vacancy defects at the perovskite crystal surface, suppressing charge recombination and facilitating charge transportation effectively. Meanwhile, adjacent crystal surfaces are linked through the hexane alkyl chain of 1,6-DD molecule, which enhances the interaction between perovskite grains and anchors the microstructure of perovskite to some degree. Hydrophobic hexane alkyl chains also increase the moisture resistance of perovskite film. Thus, an easy and effective way is provided for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.",

With regards to Th-ALD encapsulated devices, PTAA based PSCs experienced a smaller power conversion efficiency (PCE) drop than spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs after thermal stress at 65\u202f\u00b0C. This is due to the presence of pinholes within spiro-OMeTAD layer after thermal stress which are not observed in PTAA. Finally, we successfully achieve excellent durability test results for mesoporous (HC(NH2)2PbI3)0.85(CH3NH3PbBr3)0.15/PTAA devices encapsulated by 50\u202fnm Al2O3 with less than 4% drop in PCE after 7500\u202fh (>\u202f10 months) of exposure to 50%RH under room temperature.",

However, some inherent shortcomings impede their further industrialization: 1) the toxicity of Pb, 2) unstable, sensitive to moisture and/or light. To circumvent these issues, we study the lead-free and solution-processed photovoltaic devices based on the double-metals <111>-oriented 2D layered formamidinium germanium-antimony halide perovskites (FA4GeIISbIIICl12) in this contribution. Compared with benchmark MAPbI3, the larger formamidinium is selected to replace methylammonium to form a more stable crystal structure while the double metals germanium-antimony (GeII-SbIII) are chosen to replace Pb under the considerations that expanding the possible metal combinations in the design of new perovskite with analogous photovoltaic performance. The FA4GeIISbIIICl12 perovskite behaves as a stable and efficient semiconductor with direct bandgap of ~ 1.3\u202feV and its conductivity is one order of magnitude higher than that of MAPbI3. Meanwhile, FA4GeIISbIIICl12 based solar cell with power conversion efficiency up to 4.7% can be achieved without use of any additives.

It is noted that the NPB buffer layer can obviously reduce the pinholes and defects of perovskite film, and adjust the energy level mismatch between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS layer. Moreover, the carrier recombination of NPB-modified device is restricted due to the reduced defects in perovskite layer and at PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. As a result, the device power conversion efficiency is improved from 15.4% to 18.4%. The flexible devices are further fabricated with the best efficiency of 14.4% without hysteresis.

To meet the requirements for high-speed roll-to-roll fabrication of PSCs, it is important to develop anode interlayers that is easy to process to optimize the perovskite morphology. Here we use bidentate chelating ligand 2,2\u2019-bipyridine to modulate the interfacial properties between NiOx and the perovskite, via its strong interactions with the two layers. The improved interfacial contact is beneficial to the crystal growth of the perovskite. The resulting film exhibits more homogeneous morphology with enhanced crystallinity and reduced trap states, in contrast with the perovskite film on the pristine NiOx layer.

A uniform and compact hole-blocking layer is necessary for high efficient perovskite-based thin film solar cells. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of TiO2 compact layer using various methods and its effects on the PV performance of perovskite solar cells. TiO2 compact layer was prepared by a sol-gel method based on titanium isopropoxide and HCl, spin-coating of titanium diisopropoxide bis (acetylacetonate), screen-printing of Dyesol\u2019s bocking layer titania paste, and a chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique via hydrolysis of TiCl4, respectively. The morphological and micro-structural properties of the formed compact TiO2 layers were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The analyses of devices performance characteristics showed that surface morphologies of TiO2 compact films played a critical role in affecting the efficiencies. The nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited via the CBD route acts as the most efficient hole-blocking layer and achieves the best performance in perovskite solar cells. The CBD-based TiO2 compact and dense layer offers a small series resistance and a large recombination resistance inside the device, and makes it possible to achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 12.80%.",

In this paper, a novel fabrication of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 thin films based on direct metal surface elemental reaction (DMSER) method in an ambient atmosphere is discussed. The as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 thin films are highly pure and crystalline. Consequent Transient photovoltaic (TPV) tests were conducted and show that these thin films have a long minority carrier lifetime as good as the perovskite thin films obtained via common two-step method from the literature. Although there have been many studies that have developed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) during the past five years, the current study is the first report using elemental Pb as a precursor to fabricate perovskite solar cells, which were found to be relatively stable upon storage without encapsulation in glove box for more than 200 days. This Pb-initiated in-situ reaction allows for the fabrication of large area and uniform perovskite thin films. For example, in our preliminary studies, we have fabricated large area solar cell device samples (1.10\u00b10.05cm2) and have evaluated their photovoltaic performance under standard conditions (AM 1.5, 100mWcm\u22122).",

In this work, we thoroughly investigated the effect of the interspace of TiO2 nanorod (NR) arrays on the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Along with the interspace in TiO2-NR arrays increasing, the thickness as well as the crystal size of perovskite capping layer are reduced accordingly, and the filling of perovskite in the channel becomes incomplete. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that this variation of perovskite absorber layer, induced by interspace of TiO2 NR arrays, causes the change of charge recombination process at the TiO2/perovskite interface, suggesting that a balance between capping layer and the perovskite filling is critical to obtain high charge collection efficiency of PSCs. A power conversion efficiency of 10.3% could be achieved through careful optimization of interspace in TiO2-NR arrays.

The replacement of compact PbI2 (c-PbI2) by ln-PbI2, results in a significant improvement of crystallinity of perovskite films, besides the elimination of remnant PbI2. As a result, ln-PbI2 based perovskite solar cells display much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability. Moreover, annealing duration was found to be critical for high PCE and was optimized as 60min. Finally, with the optimal process, the champion device displayed a PCE of 13.8% and the average PCE reached 10.1% with a satisfactory deviation. Furthermore, we found annealing at high temperature (140\u00b0C) led to a lower PCE compared with that annealed at 75\u00b0C, because non-radiative defects increased significantly during high-temperature annealing.

In this work, a two-step sequential deposition method is modified to achieve an appropriate property of perovskite (MAPbI3) film. Surface treatment of perovskite layer and its precursor have been systematically performed and their morphologies have been investigated. By pre-wetting of lead iodide (PbI2) and letting it dry before reacting with methylammonium iodide (MAI) provide better coverage of perovskite film onto ZnO nanorod substrate than one without any treatment. An additional MAI deposition followed with toluene drop-casting technique on the perovskite film is also found to increase the coverage and enhance the transformation of PbI2 to MAPbI3. These lead to longer charge carrier lifetime, resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 1.21% to 3.05%. The modified method could been applied to a complex ZnO nanorods/TiO2 nanoparticles substrate. The enhancement in PCE to 3.41% is observed.

Density-functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Ag prefers to occupy the substitutional Ni site (AgNi) and behaves as an acceptor in NiO lattice. Compared with the pristine NiOx films, appropriate Ag doping can increase the optical transparency, work function, electrical conductivity and hole mobility of NiOx films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films grown on Ag:NiOx exhibit better crystallinity, higher coverage and smoother surface with densely packed larger grains than those grown on the pristine NiOx film. Consequently, the Ag:NiOx HTL boosts the efficiency of the inverted planar heterojunction PeSCs from 13.46% (for the pristine NiOx-based device) to 16.86% (for the 2at.% Ag:NiOx-based device). Furthermore, the environmental stability of PeSCs based on Ag:NiOx HTL is dramatically improved compared to devices based on organic HTLs and pristine NiOx HTLs.

Herein, a hydrophobic \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb,Er up-conversion ultrathin layer with particle size ca. 6\u202fnm was first applied to modify the MAPbI3 film for optimizing the surface of perovskite film. Thereby, the corresponding PSCs yield a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.17% compared with that (13.32%) of the pristine PSCs. Furthermore, the PSCs also have a good stability in air atmosphere (relative humidity \u226445%) because of the introduction of this hydrophobic material. After a series of detailed investigations and comparison, it can be easily concluded that the filled pinholes and gaps in perovskite films via \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles is the main reason for the performance enhancement of the \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb,Er based PSCs, which can result in an enhanced hole extraction efficiency and reduced interface charge recombination. As a conclusion, it is a feasible and effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs by filling up the pinholes and gaps in perovskite films with up-conversion ultrathin layers.",

    "Enhanced performance of perovskite solar cells based on vertical TiO2 nanotube arrays with full filling of CH3NH3PbI3\n": {
        "abstract": "Due to a wide range of intriguing properties, such as efficient one-dimensional (1D) electron pathways and extraordinarily large surface areas, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube arrays are considered as the promising electron transport material for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to directly synthesize the TiO2 nanotube arrays with well-controlled geometries (e.g., diameter and height, etc.) on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Here, vertically standing TiO2 nanotube arrays with desirable heights and diameters are directly synthesized on the FTO surface by employing the aqueous TiO2 sol-gel method on tubular photoresist templates. The tube height can be precisely tailored within a range of 350\u2013900\u202fnm for the effective loading of perovskite precursor solution. Importantly, it is demonstrated that TiO2 nanotube arrays with the optimized tube diameter and length can facilitate the infiltration of perovskite precursor solution, and thus ensuring the formation of a dense, smooth and large grain-sized perovskite film. Moreover, the contact between the perovskite and TiO2 nanotube arrays are enhanced simultaneously. Benefiting from the high-quality perovskite film, good interfacial contact at the perovskite/TiO2 tube interface, enhanced light trapping as well as rapid electron collection and transport induced by one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes, the fabricated PVSCs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 14.13%. Our work does not only demonstrate the promising potential of vertical TiO2 nanotube arrays for PVSCs, but also provides valuable insights into the design and utilization of TiO2 nanotubes for practical applications.",

Atomic force microscopy, UV\u2013Vis, FTIR and XRD spectroscopy were used to determine thickness, morphological and structural changes with annealing temperature, including refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical band gap and removal of organic content. These differently sintered layers were used as the compact hole blocking layers in dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells systems, keeping all other processes of cells preparation below 150\u202f\u00b0C (including mesoporous oxides layers), simulating thus the low-T processes. Some jumps of blocking layer parameters found within sintering are related to a step increase of the efficiency of dye-senzitized cells at 150\u202f\u00b0C, that can be useful in the low-temperature process, e.g. if TiAcAc is used as a binder of nanoparticles. However, deeper structural changes of the layers leading to higher efficiency were found out just above 350\u202f\u00b0C. It is caused primarily by too high series resistances of low-T blocking layers that are very amorphous. So the addition of more conductive (anatase) nanoparticles into the blocking layer is much demanded. In any case, it is meaningful to use maximum acceptable temperature in the low-T process (e.g. on plastic substrates) of TiAcAc application in solar cells, where can be concluded that perovskite cells are more sensitive to defects and quality of blocking layer than dye-sensitized ones.",

The power conversion efficiency of the solar cells fabricated via spray deposition in the air increased from 9.36% (Voc\u202f=\u202f0.86\u202fV, Jsc\u202f=\u202f17.21\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, FF\u202f=\u202f0.63) to 12.79% (Voc\u202f=\u202f0.93\u202fV, Jsc\u202f=\u202f21.56\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, FF\u202f=\u202f0.64).

Here, monodispersed SnO2 microspheres consisted of aggregated small primary nanocrystallites are synthesized via a surfactant-free solvothermal method. These SnO2 microspheres have high specific surface area, excellent crystallinity and tunable building units. By precisely controlling the nucleation and growth, the obtained microspheres exhibit narrow size distribution, whose diameters are 200\u202f\u00b1\u202f17 and 191\u202f\u00b1\u202f16\u202fnm from pure n-propanol and n-propanol/water mixed solvents, respectively. The sizes of primary nanocrystals slightly increase with the adscititious water. The SnO2 microspheres exhibit large specific surface areas, leading to efficient sensitizer-loading in both dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The sub-micron-sized microspheres could also enhance the light-harvesting of the solar cells due to their light-scattering capability. As the primary nanocrystal multiply contacts densely to neighbouring grains, such intergrowth would improve the electron transport through the grain boundaries. Eventually, a power conversion efficiency of 3.83% is yielded for pure SnO2-based DSSCs when the SnO2 microspheres are used as the scattering layers, and an efficiency of 15.41% is obtained when they are used as the electron transport layers in PSCs.",

It is the important issue to be improved in ZnO-based perovskite solar cell (PSC). In this paper, the core-shell structure of ZnO@TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRs) is designed as electron transport layer (ETL) for PSC. A novel synthesis of PSC based on ZnO@TiO2 NRs in ambient atmosphere was proposed. The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the core-shell device is 50.46% higher than that of common ZnO nanorod device. This is due to the improved interface contact between nanorods and perovskite layer, and the suppression of charge recombination. The PCE of the TiO2 modified device shows still more than 83% after 168\u202fh, compared to that of the pristine one which decreased to less than 50%. This is due to TiO2 modification which can serve as a buffer layer to avoid direct contact between perovskite films and ZnO NRs, and inhibits the decomposition of perovskite film on ZnO NRs. Both theoretical calculation and Raman test result show that the interaction between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 is mainly the bonding between I atoms of PbI2 slabs and Ti atoms of the TiO2 surface at PbI2/TiO2 interface. The mechanism of carrier transport and recombination in the PSC based on ZnO and ZnO@TiO2 NRs was also discussed.

        "abstract": "As we known, high-efficiency of the solution-processed perovskite solar cells can be achieved by modulating the perovskite film quality. Here, the prevalent 4-tert-butylpyridine is firstly utilized as an additive of CH3NH3I solution for improving the CH3NH3PbI3 film quality fabricated with two-step deposition method. Due to the strong polarity and interaction between N atom on TBP and Pb atom on CH3NH3PbI3, this strategy leads to a substantial enhancement of the CH3NH3PbI3 film quality with larger grains, higher crystallinity and more complete coverage on the substrate than that of the pristine one. Thereby, the TBP-based CH3NH3PbI3 film simultaneously exhibits superior optical properties and surface hydrophobicity. By optimization, the perovskite solar cells fabricated with TBP addition at a volume ratio of 7/1000 (v/v, TBP/isopropanol) exhibits significant performance enhancement with a power conversion efficiency reaching 17.06%, while the pristine one merely obtains a lower value of 14.56%. More importantly, this type of cells also shows a desirable efficiency reproducibility and long-time stability in air atmosphere. In conclusion, our work demonstrates another meaningful application for the TBP additive and provides a facile and effective strategy for further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells.",

The grown Li(Gd,Y)F4:Yb,Er UCNCs displayed tetragonal bipyramidal morphologies and intense UC green luminescence. The octahedral UCNCs were blended into the Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTL with different weight ratios. At an optimal weight ratio of UCNCs, the PSCs based on the upconverting transport hole layer achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 18.34% under AM1.5G illumination, an increase over 25% compared with conventional HTL based PSCs (14.69%). We systematically explore the optical and electrical enhancement effects of Li(Gd,Y)F4:Yb,Er UCNCs via UV\u2013visible absorption, diffused reflectance, external quantum efficiency (EQE), steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, photocurrent property and the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements. It was found that with the addition of the octahedral UCNCs in a proper proportion the composite HTL exhibits high charge carrier mobility and charge carrier transfer/collection capability. Besides, the embedded UCNCs boost the light harvesting of the PSCs over a large range of wavelengths from 400\u202fnm to 800\u202fnm.

Despite the high power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a TiO2 electron transport layer, the MAPI/TiO2 interface is believed as an electron accumulation position during device operation. To elucidate the cause of the electron accumulation, the energy level alignment at the MAPI/TiO2 interface should be understood. However, a buried MAPI/TiO2 interface forms after a thick MAPI layer deposition; thus, the electronic structure of the MAPI/TiO2 interface cannot be measured using surface-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy in a conventional stack-up manner. In this study, we investigated the electronic structure of a buried MAPI/TiO2 interface by removing the MAPI and organic layers using solvent immersion. As a result, we reveal that a conduction band minimum (CBM) mismatch occurs owing to the TiOPb bonding on the TiO2 surface. The TiOPb bonds form by the Pb ions penetrating during the spin coating of the MAPI solution. When a [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer was inserted, the CBM mismatch was removed owing to the high work function of PCBM.",

        "abstract": "The planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells, where the perovskite film is deposited directly onto a flat hole blocking layer, have recently attracted a great deal of attention owing to their high performance and ease of processing. However, the interface and its underlying role in carrier transport/recombination kinetics for such perovskite devices prepared under ambient air is still obscure. Herein, we addressed this issue by a dynamic intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) model using a continuity equation. The interface and its role in charge-carrier transport/recombination kinetics have been explored and discussed as an approach to understand the origin of the photovoltaic properties for the devices prepared under ambient air. The experimental IMVS responses were measured and satisfactorily fitted to the analytical results. Compared to the typical IMVS model based on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the better IMVS fitting results presented in this study indicated that there was a discrepancy between the planar perovskite devices and those of DSSCs in electron transport/recombination properties, because carrier transfer across the TiO2/liquid electrolyte interface in DSSCs has been modified. That is, the Schottky interface in DSSCs needs to be replaced by the semiconductor heterojunction interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Besides, the interface exhibits a more significant role in determining the carrier transport/recombination process by influencing the boundary conditions in a continuity equation. Furthermore, the intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy responses demonstrated that the carrier recombination characteristic is ultimately related with the surface and defect density in the interface. Interfacial modification, such as air-annealing, resulting in crystallographic changes, oxygen passivation, and variation in grain domain size, could suppress carrier recombination and prolong charge lifetime, which can yield more photo-generated electrons to be collected by anode, subsequently resulting in strikingly improving photovoltaic performance of the devices. In short, the dynamic IMVS model would help in elucidating the role of interface and the importance of interfacial modification or even interface design in order to obtain a highly efficient solar cell. The study can not only pave the way to construct the current\u2212voltage curve using a continuity equation model, but also provide new insights into the performance-improving steps for the PSCs prepared under fully open air conditions, which is of great importance for their future commercialization.",

        "abstract": "Inverted organometal halide perovskite solar cells of p-i-n architecture allow for the employment of inorganic components that ensure longer time stability than organic charge transporters. This has been demonstrated in the present work where devices were made by employing NiO/GO and Li-modified GO/TiOx as hole and electron transporters, respectively, in comparison with popular organic components, such as PEDOT:PSS and PCBM. Cells made in the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM/Al composition were 25% more efficient than cells made in the FTO/NiO/GO/Perovskite/GO-Li/TiOx/Al composition but the latter was markedly more stable than the former. Emphasis has been presently given to the characterization of the inorganic components, which can thus be employed for the construction of solar cells under ambient conditions with descent 11.2% efficiency. The GO/GO-Li based perovskite solar cell devices showed reasonable stabilized efficiency, high reproducibility and a negligible hysteresis effect.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrated a simple and effective modification of graphene oxide (GO) to enhance the device performance of perovskite photovoltaics. The surface chemistry and morphology of GO was tailored by irradiating aqueous GO solution with 60Co \u03b3-ray. During the irradiation, hydroxyl radicals were believed to be released from water radiolysis and oxidized the surface of pristine GO sheets, supposedly. Furthermore, large GO agglomerates scattered as individual GO sheets with small lateral dimensions, which is advantageous to uniform distribution of GO sheets in PEDOT:PSS layer. PEDOT:PSS layer with \u03b3-ray irradiated GO (\u03b3-GO) facilitated efficient hole transport properties in perovskite solar cells. PEDOT:PSS layer became more hydrophobic by embedding \u03b3-GO after thermal annealing and thus improved the crystallinity of perovskite layer on top of the PEDOT:PSS. Consequently, embedding \u03b3-GO in PEDOT:PSS layer resulted in better electrical properties than PEDOT:PSS layer without GO or with pristine GO. As a result, power conversion efficiency was improved owing to increased charge generation/extraction, and photoluminescence in the perovskite photoactive layer.",

A new graphene transfer method was developed, and the position was carefully optimized between the CuSCN and Au electrode in a full cell considering the band alignment of cell components. There was a negligible change in maximum PCE (15.2\u201315.8%) with the incorporation of graphene due to the high hole mobility of graphene. The moisture intrusion was significantly reduced under 85% relative humidity (RH) for 3 weeks, suppressing PbI2 formation. The graphene barrier maintained >94% of initial PCE under 50% RH for 30 days. It mostly inhibited I\u2212 ion migration and perfectly blocked Au diffusion between the perovskite and Au electrode, allowing reversible recovery of electrical power during 3 continuous illumination/dark cycles (12\u202fh each) with a positive bias.

However, most of the reported high-performance PSCs are based on the toxic anti-solvents, which is a major issue for the potential commercialization of PSCs. SnO2 has been successfully used as an efficient electron transport layer (ETL) material in PSCs, but the preparation of low-temperature processed crystallization SnO2 ETLs is still a challenge. In this work, ethyl acetate (EA) as a green antisolvent is introduced into the perovskite crystallization process, resulting in uniform and compact perovskite films with large grain size, reduced grain boundaries, and low defect density. Low-temperature (100\u202f\u00b0C) processed SnO2 ETL provides good interface contact between ETL and perovskite layer, facilitating photoelectron extraction and transport. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.83% has been achieved. More importantly, unencapsulated PSC retains 84.80% of its original PCE value after storage in atmosphere for 80\u202fdays (>1900\u202fh). Apart from great air stability, the final devices also show excellent thermal (100\u202f\u00b0C) stability. It is particularly noteworthy that all the preparation and measurement processes were performed under ambient conditions. These findings present a green path towards manufacturing efficient and stable air-processed PSCs.",

    "Influence of Lewis base HMPA on the properties of efficient planar MAPbI3 solar cells fabricated by one-step process assisted by Lewis acid-base adduct approach": {
        "abstract": "To fabricate efficient MAPbI3 perovskites using the Lewis acid-base adduct approach, we used a Lewis base hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) having a high donor number (DN), and investigated the effect of high-DN HMPA treatment on the properties of planar MAPbI3-based solar cells. The main functions of the HMPA treatment were to passivate the perovskites by forming well-distributed PbI2 phases and to densify the perovskites by controlling the rate constants. The treatment with Lewis base HMPA by one-step spin coating and subsequent solvent washing promoted the formation of pinhole-free perovskite films by increasing the coordination ability of HMPA with Pb2+ adducts and controlling the nucleation and growth rates of the perovskites. In addition, treatment with various concentrations of HMPA led to the formation of a residual PbI2 phase that acted as a passivation layer, even though stoichiometric quantities of precursors were used. Through a series of advanced electron microscopy studies, the exact three-dimensional locations of the PbI2 passivation layers were determined. Furthermore, by calculating the decreased active trap concentrations and carrier densities, we verified the passivation effect of remnant PbI2. Importantly, we achieved the best power conversion efficiency of 17.09% by the controlled addition of Lewis base HMPA, thus demonstrating a much improved performance than that obtained without HMPA treatment (15.73%).",

In this context, a highly soluble D-A based random copolymeric benzodithiophene-thienopyrroledione-thienothiophene derivatives (RCP-BTT) HTM has been derived from the backbone structure of Poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7).

By varying EDA content (0\u201310.0\u202fv/v %) in the precursor, we could find out that adequate EDA additive (~5.0%) provide much reduced electrical resistivity and enhanced optical transmission compared with control NiOx film (No EDA) by suppressing formation of byproducts (i.e. nickel hydroxide). In addition, AFM surface topography showed much compact and dense deposition of NiOx film on ITO electrode. This contributed to improve charge transport properties and suppress charge recombination loss at ITO/perovskite interface, which provided strong enhancement in fill factor from 0.599 to 0.714 in the perovskite solar cells.

However, the interfacial contact between perovskite film and TNRAs is one of the main factors that restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TNRAs based PSCs at present. In this paper, by employing a two-step spin-coating method, the influence of PbI2 solvent such as PbI2/DMSO\u00a0+\u00a0ACN and PbI2/DMSO\u00a0+\u00a0DMF\u00a0+\u00a0HAc solutions, on the preparation and performance of TNRAs based PSCs was intensively investigated. More importantly, the relationship between the micro-characteristics of perovskite film, especially the interfacial contact between perovskite film and TNRAs, and macro-properties of PSCs was elucidated. Experimental results indicate that two compact perovskite films with similar large grain size were synthesized on TNRAs from the two different PbI2 solvents, which leads to similar short circuit current densities (Jsc). However, the PSC from PbI2/DMSO\u00a0+\u00a0DMF\u00a0+\u00a0HAc solution shows a larger Voc of 1.10\u202fV compared with that from PbI2/DMSO\u00a0+\u00a0ACN solution, and thus a higher PCE of 16.57% was achieved under natural ambient conditions.

The Er3+, Yb3+ co-doped TiO2 NRs exhibit an inverted pyramidal morphology, which is beneficial for perovskite permeation and light utilization. Notably, the Er3+, Yb3+ co-doping causes changes in the band gap of TiO2 and leads to 25% increase in the current density.

        "abstract": "Novel 9,9\u2032-bifluorenylidene derivatives were designed to study the effect of alkyl chain length on selected physical properties. The structure of the synthesized compounds was confirmed by using NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, H\u2013H COSY, H\u2013C HMQC, H\u2013C HMBC) and elemental analysis. They showed high thermal stability and undergo decomposition in the range of 388\u2013400\u202f\u00b0C. As was revealed by DSC investigations, they can be converted from crystalline to amorphous materials with relatively high glass transition temperature. The replacement of the alkyl chains from ethyl to butyl resulted in a significant negative impact on melting and glass transition temperatures. The synthesized derivatives undergo reversible electrochemical oxidation and reduction and showed a very low energy band gap (1.47 and 1.79\u202feV). They intensively absorb the light up 550\u202fnm and also exhibited a week absorption band in the range of 550\u2013750\u202fnm. Their hole transporting ability was tested in perovskite solar cells. Additionally, the effect of the doping concentration of Li+ on photovoltaic device performance for these compounds was investigated. It should be stressed found that 9,9\u2032-bifluorenylidene derivative substituted with ethyl units applied as hole transporting materials in perovskite solar cells demonstrated the highest device efficiency of 7.33% higher than of the spiro-OMeTAD utilized for preparation of the reference cell (4.40%).",

        "abstract": "Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention due to their high power conversion efficiency and low cost. However, an anomalous hysteresis effect exists in the perovskite solar cells, especially with TiO2 as the n-type electron extraction layer. In this communication, we prepare two kinds of TiO2 compact layers using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and Spin-Coating (SC) methods and compare their influences on the hysteresis effect. By efficiency comparison and AC impedance spectroscopy study, we find that the thickness and morphology of compact layer have a significant influence on the hysteresis effect. Compared to the SC approach, the ALD prepared compact layer is ultra-thin with uniform morphology and shows small interfacial capacitance and large recombination resistance, meaning reduced interfacial charge accumulation and accelerated electron transport, which would relieve the hysteresis effect.",

Herein, we addressed this aspect through employing the band-tunable metal chalcogenide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) QDs as HTM into perovskite solar cells. By replacing sulfur with selenium atom, the band gap of HTM was tuned from 1.64eV to 1.14eV and their influences on cell performances were further discussed. Though the Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) device with higher hole transport ability could improve the fill factor (FF), its Voc was still remarkably lower than that of the CZTS device. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicated that the Voc loss (45mV) induced by recombination here was far less than the Voc differences between the two devices (140mV). After analyzing the band level alignment at TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM heterojunction, we proposed that the Voc enhancement of CZTS device was mainly ascribed to the more downward valence band-edge shift of HTM. This further approves that developing a wide band gap material without hindering charge injection is more pressing rather than depressing recombination process for future metal chalcogenide HTM researches.",

In this research, we developed a sequential dip-spin coating method in which the perovskite solution can easily infiltrate the pores within the TiO2 nanoparticulate layer, and the resultant film has large crystalline grains without voids between them. As a result, a higher short circuit current is achieved owing to the large interfacial area of TiO2/perovskite, along with enhanced power conversion efficiency, compared to the conventional spin coating method. The as-made pore-filled and void-free perovskite film avoids intrinsic moisture and air and can effectively protect the diffusion of degradation factors into the perovskite film, which is advantageous for the long-term stability of PSCs.",

Ba2+ is chosen to substitute Pb2+ for its similar valence state and ionic radius with Pb2+. Ba2+ doping in perovskite (mol%\u2009<5) slightly enlarges the optic energy gap by conduction band minimum(CBM) upshifting to vacuum energy level, which is due to the smaller electronegativity of Ba than Pb. The enlarged band gap is also verified by density function theory calculations. In n-i-p structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs), because of the higher CBM of doped perovskite, the Fermi energy difference between n and p side is enlarged and the electron injection from the perovskite to TiO2 is improved. Thus, both the photovoltage and photocurrent are improved by small amount Ba2+ doping, resulting optimized 17.4% efficiency under AM1.5.

The CsxMA1\u2212xPbI3 films are formed by the reaction of Cs doped PbI2 films with MAI vapor in a simple oven. We demonstrate a simple method for obtaining CsxMA1\u2212xPbI3 films with Cs content as high as 20% without phase segregation of CsPbI3 or CsI. Impedance spectra measurements reveal that Cs incorporation into MAPbI3 increases recombination resistance, up to 83% (28 vs. 15\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm2), resulting in higher open circuit voltage and efficiency. The photovoltaic performance is considerably improved by Cs doping, with the highest efficiency being 14.1% for the Cs0.1MA0.9PbI3 cells compared with 13% for the MAPbI3 ones.

High surface area nickel oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by precipitation and successfully dispersed in isopropanol with the aid of ball milling, which was confirmed to breakdown the aggregates and stabilize the dispersion without the assistance of a stabilizing agent. This strategy leads to deposition of nickel oxide nanoparticles on perovskite layer without damaging the underneath perovskite layer and inhibiting the charge transfer between individual nanoparticles, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence quenching and J-V measurements. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed excellent matching of the band alignment of nickel oxide layers with that of perovskite.

The mixed halide perovskite of MAPbI3-xClx attracts a great of attentions due to its excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the role of chlorine in MAPbI3-xClx is still under discussion by now. Here we introduce PbCl2 as additives into PbI2/DMF solution to study its effects on the formation of MAPbI3-xClx film, which is fabricated from Lewis acid-base adducts through a modified two step method. We demonstrate that the chloride ions have positive roles in fabrication of high quality perovskite MAPbI3-xClx films, characterized by high crystallization, strong grain orientation, large grain size and lower trap densities. Compared to perovskite solar cells without chloride incorporation, the performance of solar cells based on MAPbI3-xClx improves significantly due to its high carrier mobility, efficient carrier transportation and low recombination in device.",

The prominent increment is mainly attributed to the faster charge extraction, better electrical conductivity and suppressed charge recombination of Mg-doped TiO2. Besides, using highly stable CuPc and commercial carbon makes the as-prepared PSCs highly durable over 30 days when exposed to the ambient air with a relative humidity of 50%.

It is found that guanidine thiocyanate additive can notably improve the power conversion efficiency and the stability of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells due to the improvement of quality and crystal structure of perovskite films.

Various characterizations and analyses attest the enhanced charge transport and extraction as well as suppressed charge recombination and hysteresis for the C60-based devices.

The flower-based PSCs demonstrate superior photovoltaic performance compared to control ZnO or one-dimensional (1-D) fiber-shaped nano-structure ETL based devices. Nano-structured ETLs passivate the interstitial trap sites in pristine ZnO by intercalation of metal atoms in host ZnO lattice matrix and increase the n-type conductivity of the (nano-structured) ETL films by reducing the functional groups on ZnO surface. The accumulated ions at the perovskite/ETL interface are also well-distributed and hence the accumulation capacitance is significantly reduced in nano-structured ETL based PSCs, due to the branch-structured ETL network. Moreover, the nano-flower based PSC demonstrates superior charge transfer property, compared to nano-fiber based PSC owing to enhanced material crystallinity and higher effective surface area of 3-D nano-flower network, with respect to 1-D nano-fiber structure. The photo-current hysteretic phenomena are also most suppressed in nano-flower based PSC, due to mitigated electrode polarization mechanism in it. Adding to the merits, PSCs incorporating nano-flower ETL demonstrate enhanced device stability compared to the control devices, retaining about 92% of its initial efficiency even after a month. The enhanced device stability with nano-flower based PSC is contributed by the lower hydrophilicity, lower extent of functional surface hydroxyl group and lower content of vacant interstitial trap sites of the respective ETL film.",

Using a typical planar structure of the cells prepared under fully open air condition, the steady-state efficiency of our best-performing devices has improved from 15.96 to 18.38%.",

After 1000\u00a0h, the Cs0.05MA0.95PbI3 devices maintained more than 90% of their initial PCE. The long-term stability can be attributed to the synergistic interaction of Cs+ on the solid solution strengthening of MAPbI3 and the protection of the hydrophobic carbon electrode on the perovskite active layer.",

        "abstract": "Excess PbI2 has been widely introduced in halide perovskite precursor solution to passivate the grain boundary defects in high efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the passivation effect is highly sensitive to the PbI2 content and overmuch PbI2 affects the crystalline growth and charge transport. We report here a precious control of excess PbI2 into perovskite grain boundaries by methylamine treatment for efficacious defects passivation and charge extraction. The crystallization of the deposited perovskite films was carefully evaluated and the charge recombination dynamics were systematically analyzed through time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, space charge limited current, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis. The precise PbI2 introduction to the grain boundaries results in a significantly lower defect state density, efficient charge extraction and prolonged carrier lifetime, causing a notable increase of short-circuit current density and negligible hysteresis in the corresponding device. Our work demonstrates a reliable method to alleviate the rigorous tolerance of PbI2 excess in high efficient PSCs.",

The obtained P1 was converted to its P2 polyrotaxane by the end capping of the PEDOT backbones with bulky triphenylmethane to avoid the dethreading of TM\u03b2CD. The chemical structures of P1 and P2 were proved by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The coverage ratios of the P1 and P2 chains were found to be 43.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2% and 27.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8%, respectively. Rotaxane formation results in improvements of the solubility in common organic solvents, as well better film forming ability combined with a high transparency.

The newly synthesized compounds were then applied as dopant/additive-free hole transport materials in perovskite solar cells. P1 exhibited a photovoltaic performance of 5.54% under 1 sun illumination, whereas P2 showed a lower efficiency (3.8%) attributed to its lower photocurrent density.

In this paper, we developed a vapor-assisted solution process using a novel and green solvent of 1-Ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP) instead of the traditional N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to construct a high-quality perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with pure phase, high compactness, small surface roughness and controlled size. The phase evolution and growth mechanism of the perovskite films are also discussed. Utilizing the NEP of low volatility and moderate boiling point as solvent, we dried the PbI2-NEP precursor films at different temperature under vacuum and then obtained PbI2 thin films with different crystalline degree from amorphous to highly crystalline. The perovskite films with crystal size ranged from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers can be prepared by reacting the PbI2 films of different crystalline degree with CH3NH3I vapor.

The use of different ratios of DMSO leads to four different complexes of MAI\u00b7PbI2\u00b7DMF and MAI\u00b7PbI2\u00b7(DMSO)y (y\u00a0=\u00a00.6, 1.5, 1.9), thus dramatically influencing the crystallization of perovskite films. Of these complexes, optimized MAI\u00b7PbI2\u00b7(DMSO)1.5 intermediate adduct enables highly dense perovskite thin films with large grain size and enhances efficient perovskite solar cells with high charge carrier lifetime.",

        "abstract": "A mesoporous NiOx (m-NiOx) film which is deposited from a precursor using solution-derived Ni(OH)2 nanosheets as the starting material is employed as the hole transport layer to fabricate the perovskite solar cell. A simple annealing process at 500\u00a0\u00b0C in air decomposes the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets into NiOx nanoparticles, removes organic components, and produces nanopores in the film, leading to the formation of m-NiOx films at once. Results indicate that the annealing time has a great effect on the morphology and crystallinity of the resulting m-NiOx films, and prolonging the annealing time leads to smaller NiOx nanoparticles, bigger pores and higher crystallinity, which contribute to a better device performance. After a careful optimization, the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.97% is achieved on the device based on the m-NiOx film annealed at 500\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h. This work provides a new method to prepare efficient m-NiOx films for high performance perovskite solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Though numerous methods have been proposed to fabricate high-efficient perovskite solar cells, each method seems to be lack of deserved attention on the relation of experimental details with the device performance. Herein, we focus on this issue by tuning the concentration of precursor solution for fabricating perovskite solar cells based on a simple structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ca/Al. An interesting correlation between precursor solution concentration and device performance parameters has been observed. With the concentration tuned from 1 to 1.75\u00a0M, the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and thus power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the fabricated photovoltaic device increase obviously. Further increase in concentration deteriorates the device efficiency. Extensive measurements including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) reveal that the concentration-induced morphology changes particularly in grain size and film quality play a key role in device performance. Insights on correlation of morphology parameters, the photo-electronic properties of the active layer and device working mechanism are provided in this paper.",

In this contribution, low temperature (about 70\u00a0\u00b0C) UV/ozone irradiation was applied to synthesis crystallized TiO2 films as ETL. The UV exposure induces photo-catalytic removal of the organic ligands and spontaneous coalescence of the TiO2 framework, resulting in excellent TiO2 films with considerable crystallinity. UV irradiation induces both complete removal of organic media and more efficient charge collection. Accordingly, planar heterojunction (PH) PSCs with such ETL exhibited outstanding photovoltaic performance up to 17.03%, which is even higher than the value (12.98%) of counterpart device with high temperature thermal sintered TiO2 ETL (without TiCl4 treatment).

Herein, spin coating and aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) are chosen to represent solution-based and vapour-based deposition routes, respectively. SnO2 films processed at low temperature via the mentioned methods are applied in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell as active photoanode and perovskite solar cell (PSC) as electron transport layer. This study discovers that spin coated SnO2 film which consists of greater amount of oxygen vacancy is beneficial for PEC cell but is detrimental towards the stability and hysteresis of PSC device. The improved PEC performance is majorly attributed to the enhanced light absorption of SnO2 caused by the reduction of its band gap energy. Meanwhile, AACVD method successfully eliminates oxygen vacancy in SnO2 crystal lattice. Although PEC cell shows very poor performance upon using AACVD-fabricated SnO2, the employment of this layer greatly enhances the overall performance of PSC. The absence of oxygen vacancy allows efficient charge transfer at SnO2/perovskite interface and renders SnO2 less hydrophobic which prevents moisture-induced degradation of perovskite layer. Our findings provide valuable information to understanding the film formation mechanism of different fabrication technologies and their suitability for particular optoelectronic application.",

    "Growth of monolithically grained CH3NH3PbI3 film by a uniform intermediate phase for high performance planar perovskite solar cells": {
        "abstract": "The growth of high-quality perovskite layers is dependent on the formed intermediate phases by an anti-solvent extraction technique. However, the intermediate phase formation is often not uniform due to the uncontrolled solvent extraction, and finally effects the perovskite layer growth. Here, a solvent-vapor-assisted post treatment is developed to obtain a homogeneous perovskite intermediate phase after anti-solvent extraction. The homogenization of the intermediate phase renders the sole upward growth mechanism of perovskite crystals during heating, affording optimal alignment with few horizontal grain boundaries and large grains. These coarsened grains across the whole perovskite film facilitate efficient carrier transport and reduce charge recombination. As a result, the resulting planar perovskite solar cell (PeSC) has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%, compared to the as-prepared PeSC of 15.7%. Via solvent-vapor-assisted treatment, the operating time window of anti-solvent extraction was prolonged significantly, and correspondingly, a narrowed efficiency distribution was obtained. Thus, the influence of the operating time on the cell efficiency is released, effectively promoting the operability of practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Despite intensive studies on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by employing graphene transparent conductive electrodes (GR TCEs), no use of n-type GR as a TCE has been reported for PSCs. It is known to be technologically more easy to prepare p-type GR TCEs than n-type ones because even pristine GR usually exhibits p-type characteristics in air. P-type GR can be employed in p-i-n-type PSCs as a TCE, but not in n-i-p-type ones. In addition, most of the p-i-n-type structures are not suitable for flexible substrates due to the inherent high-temperature annealing process. Here, n-type (Ag nanowires-doped) GR TCEs are first used for n-i-p CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) PSCs. With increasing the doping concentration (nA) of Ag nanowires to 0.3\u202fwt%, the sheet resistance (Rs) and transmittance (T) of the TCE monotonically decrease to \u223c52\u202f\u03a9/sq and \u223c90%, respectively. Due to the nA-dependent trade-off relation between the Rs and the T, the DC conductivity/optical conductivity ratio is the largest (\u223c62) at nA\u202f=\u202f0.1\u202fwt%, resulting in maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 15.80 and 13.45% for the PSCs on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively, indicating PCE enhancements more than 50 and 30% by using the n-type GR TCEs.",

Moreover, the photovoltaic properties of the fabricated PSCs were analyzed to elucidate the effect of NiO@C on them. By inserting a NiO@C thin film between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD layers of PSCs, the number of defects at the surface of perovskite was reduced and charge transfer was more efficient, which led to the improved power conversion efficiency of the PSCs. The maximum power conversion efficiency of NiO@C-containing PSC was 15.78%, which was higher than that of the control PSC (13.79%).",

The role of B\u2013TiO2 in boosting the electron flow within the device has been elucidated using atomic force microscopy, reflectance, photoluminescence spectroscopy, space-charge-limited current mobility, and electrical impedance.

The additives concentration in anti-solution is optimized to form a mixed layer where spiro-OMeTAD is dispersive in upper perovskite films with a vertical gradient, and a capping layer with appropriate thickness. The incorporation of spiro-OMeTAD in anti-solution tremendously improve the crystallinity of perovskite films while the graded heterojunction and the derived capping layer contribute to reduced interfacial losses. Moreover, poly(methyl methacrylate) as the second additive in anti-solution further passivates defects in perovskite films. As a result, we realize perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 15.72% based on perovskite-graded heterojunction, which is far beyond the control devices.

Strong temperature-dependent photovoltaic effects have been observed in the type of solar cell, which could be mainly attributed to CH3NH3PbI3, showing a ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition at low temperature (T\u00a0< 160\u00a0K). An increase in temperature over the room temperature decreased the perovskite solar cell performance and reduced its efficiency from 16% to 9%. The investigation with electronic impedance spectroscopy reveals that at low temperature (T < 120\u00a0K) the charge transport layer limits the device performance, while at high temperature (T > 200\u00a0K), the interfacial charge recombination becomes the dominant factor.",

In this work, we have systematically studied the feasibility of all-ambient-processing of PSCs and evaluated their photovoltaic performance. It has been shown that phase-pure crystalline tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite films are instantly formed in ambient air at room temperature by a two-step spin coating process, undermining the need for dry atmosphere and post-annealing. All-ambient-processed PSCs with a configuration of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au achieve open-circuit voltage (990 mV) and short-circuit current density (20.31 mA/cm2) comparable to those of best reported glove-box processed devices. Nevertheless, device power conversion efficiency is still constrained at 5% by the unusually low fill-factor of 0.25. Dark current\u2013voltage characteristics reveal poor conductivity of hole-transporting layer caused by lack of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD species, resulting in high series-resistance and decreased fill-factor. The study also establishes that the above limitations can be readily overcome by employing an inorganic p-type semiconductor, copper thiocyanate, as ambient-processable hole-transporting layer to yield a fill-factor of 0.54 and a power conversion efficiency of 7.19%.

In general, interface band alignment is regarded as the vital factor of the BPSCs whereas only few reports on enhancing perovskite film quality. In this work, highly efficient BPSCs were fabricated by improving the crystallization process of CH3NH3PbBr3 with the assistance of anti-solvents. A new anti-solvent of diphenyl ether (DPE) was developed for its strong interaction with the solvents in the perovskite precursor solution. By using the anti-solvent of DPE, trap-state density of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film is reduced and the electron lifetime is enhanced along with the large-grain crystals compared with the samples from conventional anti-solvent of chlorobenzene. Upon preliminary optimization, the efficiencies of typical and semitransparent BPSCs are improved to as high as 9.54% and 7.51%, respectively. Optical absorption measurement demonstrates that the cell without metal electrode shows 80% transparency in the wavelength range of 550\u20131000\u202fnm that is perfect for greenhouse vegetation. Considering that the cell absorbs light in the blue spectrum before 550\u202fnm, it offers very high solar cell efficiency with only 17.8% of total photons, while over 60% of total photons can transmit through for photosynthesis if a transparent electrode can be obtained such as indium doped SnO2.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorous tetrabenzotriazacorrole (TBC) and its two soluble derivatives (TBC-1 and TBC-2) were synthesized and used for the first time as undoped hole transporting materials (HTMs) in MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Their performance in PSCs was measured and compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD and phthalocyanine precursor. The fundamental properties related to HTMs are also examined. These novel HTMs are easily prepared, cost-effective, and solution processable. The materials exhibited much higher hole transport mobility and broader light absorption than pristine Spiro-OMeTAD and phthalocyanine precursor. They can work efficiently in the absence of any dopant for devices composed of FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Au. The undoped mesoscopic solar cell devices based on TBC exhibited a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 16.2% (measured at 100\u202fmW\u202fcm2 illumination, AM 1.5\u202fG), together with good long-term stability under ambient conditions. This PCE of 16.2% observed using TBC is remarkably higher than the 11.2% observed using undoped Spiro-OMeTAD and also much better than the 8.70% observed using its phthalocyanine precursor. As to substitution effects, \u03b1-substituted TBC-1 was found to be a better HTM than \u03b2-substituted TBC-2 (PCE 11.4%) and unsubstituted TBC-3 (PCE 6.81%) under the same conditions. These results provide the basis for further exploiting TBC compounds as a new type of low-cost and effective HTM for PSCs.",

In terms of device stability, DTBT-based devices show a favorable long-term stability, which keep 83% initial efficiency after 15 days.

Herein, we demonstrate that high efficiency and stability of PSCs can be obtained by the reaction of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite with 1, 4-butanediamine iodide (BEAI2) vapor. The incorporation of BEAI2 intensively promotes the crystallization of perovskite film with large grain size (~500\u202fnm). Further characterization reveals that the post-treatment perovskite film delivered low interface trap density with long carrier lifetime (>\u202f200\u202fns), long carrier diffusion length (>\u202f600\u202fnm) and large carrier mobility (>\u202f1.5\u202fcm2\u202fV\u22121\u202fS\u22121). Solar cells employing such post-treatment films demonstrated 19.58% PCE without hysteresis.

The enhancements translate to solar cell power-conversion efficiencies of 19.2%, with a near-instant rise to stabilized power output, consistent with suppression of ion migration.

Here, we propose an intermediate-phase engineering strategy to improve the inorganic perovskite/metal oxide interface by utilizing volatile salts. The introduction of organic cations (such as methylammonium and formamidinium), which can be doped into the perovskite lattice, leads to the formation of an organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite intermediate phase, promoting a robust interfacial contact through hydrogen bonding. A champion CsPb(I0.75Br0.25)3-based device with a power conversion efficiency of 17.0% and an open-circuit voltage of 1.34\u00a0V was realized, implying that a record of over 65% of the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Conventional processing of the halide perovskite usually utilizes ionic precursor solutions containing mobile precursor ions in a high-boiling-point solvent. The assembly of these disordered ions into low-entropic crystals needs to overcome the large thermodynamic energy barrier. Traditional processes rely on high-temperature annealing and complex anti-solvent treatments to overcome this barrier, but they remain highly uncontrollable. Here, we report a novel nonionic and low-entropic MA(MMA)nPbI3 ink for fast perovskite crystallization with superior {110} preferred orientation and a high Lotgering factor. And the ink-based films exhibit an extraordinary long carrier diffusion length of 4.6\u00a0\u03bcm at the single-crystal level. With facial one-step processing, the corresponding photovoltaic cell exhibits a record efficiency of 21.8% based on the MAPbI3-system. Scaling of active area from 0.096 to 0.5\u00a0cm2 did not deteriorate the cell performance as the efficiency remained over 21%. These results demonstrate the potential of this nonionic ink for the industrial transition of perovskite photovoltaic technology.",

        "abstract": "Carbon materials have been gradually applied to perovskite solar cells as counter electrode. However, there always exists a poor interface contact between carbon and perovskite layer (C/CH3NH3PbI3), resulting in inferior performances. Herein, we introduce an additive of acetonitrile (ACN) into carbon slurry, which effectively improves the interface contact of C/CH3NH3PbI3. Because of a medium solubility for perovskite, ACN will dissolve the surface crystal of perovskite layer when the carbon slurry is doctor-bladed on the top of CH3NH3PbI3 film, which will form a liquid/liquid interface between C/CH3NH3PbI3, leading to a tighter contact. In addition, many surface grains of perovskite layer will get smaller after treated with ACN, which will enhance the light scattering performance of perovskite layer. By optimization toward the content of ACN in carbon slurry, the interface contact of C/CH3NH3PbI3 and the photovoltaic performance have been significantly improved. Compared to 7.45% of the control device, an optimal power conversion efficiency of 8.32% has been achieved for low-temperature carbon based perovskite solar cells, which shows great potential in future application.",

In the PSCs, CNTs and CH3NH2 were used to modify the interface between the perovskite and carbon electrode to improve the photoelectronic performance. In particular, CH3NH2 induced surface-healing of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films and the CNTs acted as a charge transport pathway among individual perovskite nanoparticles to facilitate the collection of photogenerated holes by the carbon electrode. A power conversion efficiency of 10.39% was achieved after modification with the CNTs and CH3NH2. In the photoanodes, the CNT-modified TiO2 electrode accelerated the electron\u2013hole separation and transportation, thereby improving the degradation performance. After assembling the PSCs modified using CNT and CH3NH2 with CNT/TiO2, the solar-driven PEC system exhibited a high PEC degradation rate with rhodamine B (RhB).

The PSC devices are fabricated in air without high-vacuum deposition which simplifies the processing and lowers the threshold of both scientific research and industrial production of PSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates good charge transport characteristics of CEs on the photovoltaic performance of devices. The PSCs exhibited good stability over 50h.

The novelty of this work is to investigate the effect of annealing temperature on the photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cell (PeSC) with these annealed TiO2/ITO structures. For the fabrication of PeSC, perovskite (PRV) layer has been fabricated on TiO2 films by two-steps method. The TiO2 film prepared at RT shows the amorphous structure with the compact surface and Ti3+ state. Interestingly, crystallinity and porosity of the TiO2 films increase with the increase of annealing temperature. The TiO2 films annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C have shown high crystallinity with Ti4+ state and mixed phases (anatase and rutile). The grain boundary becomes visible, the size and porosity of TiO2 films increase with the increase of annealing temperature. The PeSC with TiO2 films prepared at RT shows the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.15% with maximum photocurrent (14.37\u202fmA/cm2) than the other PeSCs with annealed TiO2 films. The PCE, photocurrent and fill factor of PeSC decrease but the photovoltage increases with increase in annealing temperature, which may be caused by carrier leakage between PRV layer and ITO substrate, high series and low shunt resistances, and also the enhanced sheet resistance of ITO substrate.",

The addition of rGO within the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) offers fast electron transport rates toward the anode and favors the growth of large, uniform perovskite crystals. When added in MAPbI3, rGO further increases the perovskite grains size and creates a more homogenous and smooth film with enhanced crystallinity, thus improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding PSC. On the contrary, its presence in Spiro-MeOTAD is detrimental for the cells performance. For the first time in the literature a graphene derivative favors the performance of a MAPbI3\u2013based PSC when incorporated as an additive in both the ETL and the perovskite absorber. As a result, we obtained devices with optimized electrical characteristics, resulting to stabilized 13.6% PCE, outperforming by 20% the reference (rGO-free) ones.

The devices with P3HT exhibit a substantial increase in power conversion efficiency, open circuit voltage, and fill factor, compared with the reference device without P3HT. Impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the present P3HT layer decreases the internal resistance in solar cells and allows the interface between oriented TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3-xClx to form more perfect in electronics. It is also found that the electron lifetime in the devices with P3HT is much longer than that of the device without P3HT. Thus, the charge collection efficiency of the device with P3HT is markedly enhanced, compared with the devices without P3HT. Analysis of the energy levels of the involved materials indicates that the P3HT film between the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx layer and the Au electrode provides a better energy level matching for efficient transporting holes to the anode.

We compare solar cells fabricated by sequential step deposition of the perovskite layer, where the PbI2 film is deposited using either blade or spin coating. By controlling the crystallization of the PbI2 with air flow, a highly compact layer was obtained with both techniques. The final perovskite structure was then obtained by dipping the substrates in a methylammonium iodide solution. The study and the consequent optimization of the blade coating process and the dipping time, led us to achieve 10\u00a0mm2 solar cells with a maximum efficiency of 13.3% and an average efficiency of 12.1%. To prove the scalability of the process, series connected modules were fabricated containing blade coated PbI2 films. The films were laser patterned with a CO2 laser before being dipped in the methylamine iodide solution. A module efficiency of 10.4% was obtained for a 10.1\u00a0cm2 active area.

A SnO2 layer was developed by spin-coating SnCl2 solution followed by annealing at 200\u00a0\u00b0C in air. The low-temperature (200\u00a0\u00b0C) annealed SnO2 layer exhibits enhanced crystallization, high transmittance, and uniform surface morphology using ethanol as a solvent rather than water. Solid state CuSCN hole conductor was used as HTM for reducing the device cost.

Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) demonstrates that the coverage of the perovskite capping layer exhibits a trend from rise to decline in the whole dipping time from 20s to 60s. By fine control of the dipping time, a 620\u00a0nm-thickness compact perovskite active layer is obtained at the optimized dipping time of 40s and is verified to possess strong light absorption and high electron extraction efficiency, leading to a higher photocurrent.

With the power conversion efficiencies of PSCs excessing 20%, great challenges have been focused on the issues of cost and long-term stability which are majorly related to the hole transport materials. In contrast, the PSCs without special hole conductors show great potential for commercial applications due to their cost-effective and fairly stable features. However, the inferior charge separation at the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and back electrode interface limits the cells for high efficiency. Our strategy is to arrange suitable energy band alignment at the interface to enhance the charge separation. We herein report a MAPbI3/MAPbI2Br cascade structured PSC with MAPbI2Br majorly acting as a hole conductor. The conversion efficiency of the PSCs is greatly improved and a high efficiency of 15.83% is achieved. This new design of using organic-inorganic halide perovskites as hole conductors provides an efficient approach for improving the performance of low-cost PSCs.",

The present work demonstrated effective suppression of the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite through inserting a thin tin oxide (SnO2) passivation layer between ZnO NRs and perovskite films. Although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed no distinct difference in the amount of hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies on the surface of ZnO NRs and ZnO@SnO2 NRs, Raman spectra suggested the hydroxyl groups might be trapped in oxygen vacancies on SnO2 surface, preventing the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite through reacting with the hydroxyl groups. The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells was significantly increased from 6.92% to 12.17% and became hysteresis-free by applying SnO2 passivating layer between perovskite and ZnO layers.",

Compared with PC61BM, pristine fullerenes, such as C60 and C70, have shown superiority of higher electron mobility and much lower costs. Due to the poor solubility and strong tendency to crystallize for pristine fullerenes in solution process, it is still a challenge to deposit compact and continuous film of pristine fullerenes for p-i-n type perovskite solar cells by solution processing. Herein, solution processed pristine fullerenes (C60 and C70) were used as electron transport layers to replace PC61BM in perovskite solar cells with high performance and enhanced stability. Power conversion efficiency of 14.04% was obtained by using mixture of C60 and C70 as electron transport layer, which is comparable to that of PC61BM based device (13.74%).

Light doping with W (less than 1000\u00a0ppm) improves the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells by promoting the electron conductivity in the TiO2 layer which facilitates electron transfer and collection. With the incorporation of W, average efficiency of PSCs is increased from 9.1% for the un-doped samples to 10.53% for the 1000\u00a0ppm W-doped samples, mainly originates from the increase of short circuit current density and fill factor.

In the PSC device, admittedly, Spiro-OMeTAD is the most widely used hole-transporting material (HTM). However, the pristine Spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low hole mobility and conductivity, which requires chemical dopants (Li-TFSI and tBP) to increase conductivity thereby improving power conversion efficiency (PCE). Discouragingly, hygroscopic Li-TFSI can gravely degrade the perovskite film and diminish the stability of PSC. Meanwhile, tBP also gives rise to the degradation of perovskite film by forming a [PbI2\u00b7tBP] coordinated complex or iodopyridinate complex. In this study, F4-TCNQ is introduced into Spiro-OMeTAD as an alternative dopant to replace the commonly used Li-TFSI and tBP. By optimizing the doping concentration of F4-TCNQ, the PSC based on 1.5\u00a0mol% F4-TCNQ doped Spiro-OMeTAD exhibits the best PCE as high as 12.93%, which is comparable to that of 14.32% for reference device with Li-TFSI and tBP doped Spiro-OMeTAD.

However, the conventional solid-state reaction methods, originated from the two-step method, failed to grow columnar grains of CH3NH3PbI3 in a facile way. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for growing large columnar grains of CH3NH3PbI3, by less-crystallized nanoporous PbI2 (ln-PbI2) film enhanced solid-state reaction method. We demonstrated columnar grains were obtainable only when ln-PbI2 films were applied. Therefore, the replacement of compact PbI2 by ln-PbI2 in the solid-sate reaction, leads to higher power conversion efficiency, better reproducibility, better stability and less hysteresis. Furthermore, by systematically investigating the effects of annealing temperature and duration, we found that an annealing temperature \u2265120\u00a0\u00b0C was also critical for growing columnar grains. With the optimal process, a champion efficiency of 16.4% was obtained and the average efficiency reached 14.2%. Finally, the mechanism of growing columnar grains was investigated, in which a VPb\u2033-assisted hooping model was proposed.

Here, a facile ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) modification method is demonstrated to overcome this issue. By carefully controlling the UVO modification time, the surface wettability of poly-TPD can be tuned without affecting the bulk properties of the film, hence perovskite films with desired grain size and excellent coverage can be deposited via a one-step spin-coating method. Benefiting from the high-quality perovskite, well-matched energy level alignment and hydrophobic property of poly-TPD, the resulting PVSCs show a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.19% with significantly enhanced stability as compared to the PEDOT:PSS counterparts. Moreover, the UVO modification approach also demonstrates its validity when being extended to other hydrophobic HTMs. This work not only provides a general strategy to broaden the selection pool of HTMs for solution-processed inverted planar PVSCs, but also may triggers the exploration of more advanced strategies to make non-wetting HTMs applicable in solution-processed inverted planar PVSCs.",

The overall performance of PSCs employing the metal-doped TiO2 layers is significantly improved in term of hysteresis effect, short circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, power conversion efficiency, and device stability. With the insertion of metal ions into TiO2 lattice, the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 PSC leads to a \u223c25% improved PCE of over 16% under irradiance of 100\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u22122 AM1.5G sunlight, compared with control device. The results indicate that this mild solution-processed metal-doped TiO2 is an effective industry-scale way for fabricating hysteresis-less and high-performance PSCs.",

        "abstract": "Crystallization and interface engineering of perovskite are the most important factors in achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we construct an ultrathin CdSe quantum dots (QDs) underlayer via a solution-processable method, which acts as a seed-mediated layer for perfect perovskite film, with both uniform morphology and better absorption capacity. In addition, CdSe QDs and perovskites form a fully crystalline heterojunction, which is beneficial to minimizing the defect and trap densities. Then, an Ostwald ripening process is adopted to fabricate large-grain, pinhole-free perovskite thin film, by a simple methylammonium bromide treatment. Besides, the first principle is applied in calculating organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite, confirming that electrons can move even quicker and more effectively, as a result of our work. Due to these treatments, representing a very simple method to simultaneously control perovskite crystallization and optimize the interfaces in PSCs, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 15.68% is achieved, 35% higher than the PSC both without CdSe and MABr treatment (11.57%), indicating better performance.",

At the optimum concentrations of alkali thiocyanates as additives, the as-prepared NaSCN-modified and KSCN-modified PSCs demonstrate the efficiencies of 16.59% and 15.63% respectively, being much higher than 12.73% of the reference PSCs without additives. This improvement is primarily ascribed to the enhanced electron transport, reduced recombination rates and much improved microstructures with large grain size and low defect density at grain boundaries. Importantly, it is revealed that the modified PSCs at the optimized concentrations of alkali thiocyanates additives exhibit remarkably improved stability than the reference PSCs against humid circumstance, and a continuous exposure to humid air without encapsulation over 45 days only records about 5% degradation of the efficiency.

        "abstract": "This work proposes a new perovskite solar cell structure by inserting a polymer interlayer between perovskite and hole transporting material (HTM) to minimize the interface losses via interface engineering. The multifunctional interlayers improve the photovoltaic efficiency and device stability by shielding perovskite from moisture, suppressing charge combination, and promoting hole transport. The five different polymer layers are utilized to investigate the relationships of polymer structure, layer morphology and cell performance systematically. It is found that a reliable power conversion efficiency exceeding 19.0% is realized based on P3HT/spiro-OMeTAD composite structure, surpassing that of pure spiro-OMeTAD (15.0%). Moreover, the device with P3HT interlayer shows more brilliant long-term stability than that without interlayer when exposed into moisture. The enhanced device performance based on P3HT interlayer compared with the other polymers can be ascribed to the long hydrophobic alkyl chains and the small molecule monomers of P3HT, which contribute to self-assembly of the polymers into insulating layers and formation of the efficient \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking in polymer/spiro-OMeTAD interface simultaneously.

Under UV exposure, ozone decomposes to free atomic oxygen and intercalates into the interstitial and oxygen vacancy induced defect sites in the ZnO lattice matrix, which contributes to suppressed trap-assisted recombination phenomena in perovskite device. UVO treatment also reduces the content of functional hydroxyl group on ZnO surface, that increases the inter-particle connectivity and grain size of perovskite film on UVO treated ZnO ETL. Owing to this, the perovskite film atop UVO treated ZnO film exhibits reduced micro-strain and dislocation density values, which contribute to the enhanced photovoltaic performance of PSC with modified ZnO ETL. The modified PSCs exhibit higher recombination resistance (RRec) \u223c40% compared to pristine ZnO ETL based control devices.

In this report, we use the rate of the integrated short-circuit current change (Drate) to investigate the performance degradation kinetics and identify the degradation of PSCs that is accelerated by the light current. The value of Drate increases by an order of magnitude from about 0.02 to 0.35\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122\u00b7min\u22121 after light-IV testing. The accelerated degradation progress is proven to be dominated by the hydration process and the migration of the iodine ions of the light current. The migration of the iodine ions enhances the hydration process through a chain reaction, enabling the formation of fast diffusion channels for both H2O and O2, which induce the rapid decomposition of the perovskite film and increase the density of the trap state. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement data also indicate that the super oxygen may be formed due to the PCBM damage caused by the migration iodine ions. An understanding of the degradation acceleration mechanism would provide an insight into the effect of ion migration on the stability of PSCs.",

Most of perovskite solar cells employ mesoporous device structures when using printable carbon as the counter electrodes. Here, we carry a comparative study of planar and mesoporous perovskite solar cells with carbon electrodes. The device efficiency is significantly reduced from 11.37% to 5.27% when the mesoporous TiO2 film is removed from the device structure. Compared with the planar device, smaller carrier transport resistance and bigger carrier recombination resistance are demonstrated for the mesoporous device. Results suggest that the presence of mesoporous TiO2 enables an efficient electron extraction from the perovskite absorber, which remits the serious carrier recombination in the hole transport layer free device due to the hole accumulation. Therefore, the electron extraction efficiency is crucial in these hole transport layer free devices with carbon electrodes. This study helps to develop further optimization of low temperature carbon-based perovskite solar cells for higher reproducibility and higher device performance.",

As a result, the hole extraction, transport and collection properties are significantly improved in the device using cobalt-doped nickel oxide as a hole transport layer. Also, it reveals that cobalt-doped nickel oxide reduces the trap-sites of interfaces of perovskite/hole transport layer, leading to suppressed charge recombination in the devices. As a result, the devices using cobalt-doped nickel oxide achieve as high as 17.52% without severe hysteresis, which is attributed to better band alignment, superior hole extraction and decreased resistance, as compared to pristine nickel oxide-based devices.",

As one typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, naphthalene group endows a favorable planar conformation and further extended \u03c0-conjugation, both of which accelerate the process of hole extraction and transport. In this work, two small molecule hole-transporting materials based on naphthalene core and arylamine terminal groups, termed NH-2,6 and NH-2,7, are prepared via facile synthesis from commercial precursors with a low synthetic cost. NH-2,6, which incorporates particular 2,6-substituted naphthalene core and arylamine terminal, exhibits a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital and a higher hole mobility ascribing to the discriminating structural substitution position effect and better electronic delocalization extent between naphthalene core and arylamine terminal. Thus with NH-2,6, impressive efficiency of 18.7%, which is associated with excellent reproducibility and reasonable stability, is afforded based on the optimized mixed-cation perovskite solar cells. These results not only highlights that the properties of hole-transporting materials can be tuned to some extent through the substitution position effect, but also provides the significative insights into the molecule design for facile synthesis, low-cost and efficient hole-transporting materials.",

The device is based on a mesoporous triple-layer scaffold, and the perovskite is deposited in the scaffold as a light absorber. Various solvents have been employed to prepare the perovskite precursors. However, the coordination between lead halides and the solvent molecules may lead to the formation of precipitates after a period of storage. The precipitates significantly influence the stoichiometric compositions of the precursors, and result in undesired variations in the device performance. Herein, we introduce ethanol (EtOH) into a typical \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL) based perovskite precursor. The addition of EtOH not only weaken the coordination between Pb and solvent molecules, but also facilitate the crystallization of the perovskite absorber. Besides, the EtOH modified precursor shows improved wettability on the mesoporous scaffold, spreading and penetrating more efficiently than typical precursor. Correspondingly, highly reproducible device performance with an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.95% and best PCE of 15.11% are achieved.

The device performance of 0.2% Mn-doped devices was improved compared to that of a device without Mn. However, a further increase of the doping concentration induced a decrease in performance. Several characteristics (especially different scanning probe microscopy characteristics) reveal that an increased dopant concentration results in reduced crystallinity and a change in the film morphology and causes a deterioration in photovoltaic performance for higher dopant concentrations. In the best-performing samples (0.2%), a shift in the valence band level and band gap are found which are responsible for the increased open circuit voltage, while increased grain boundaries and lower surface charge density are responsible for a small reduction in the short circuit current. Thus, multifunctional scanning probe microscopy approaches, combined with different film characterization techniques, offer us effective tools to investigate the impact of doping in the perovskite materials and the corresponding device performance.",

The drop-casted CNTs exhibit superior optical transmission and hole extraction properties compared to conventional PEDOT:PSS; however, the inherent random networks of CNTs result in many vacancies between nanotubes, causing recombination losses when employed solely as a hole transport layer in the planar architecture of solar cells. Thus, the proposed hybrid hole collector is designed by blending CNTs with various mixture ratios (10\u201350%) of PEDOT:PSS to enhance the electron-blocking properties. The preferred CNT (70%)/PEDOT:PSS (30%) composition shows a dense, pinhole-free surface and better photoluminescence quenching properties than pristine PEDOT:PSS. After device fabrication, we demonstrate that this hybrid hole collector impressively enhanced average power conversion efficiency from 13.2% to 15.6% (up to 16.0% for best-performing cell) with negligible hysteresis. Time-correlated single-photon counting and conductive atomic force microscopy analyses elucidate the performance progress for the CNT/PEDOT:PSS composite in terms of better hole collection and highly conductive characteristics.

Z1 gives a more efficient hole-transfer than Z2, and a more uniform and stable amorphous film than X2. In addition, although Z1 presents a twisted V-shaped lower symmetrical structure, it still exhibits high conductivity and hole-mobility, which arises from the molecular polarization induced by the electronegative carbazole units and multiple electropositive electron-donors. When employed in solar devices, Z1 achieves a power conversion efficiency up to 18.57% without current hysteresis.

It is found that the antimonene oxide quantum dots have proper energy level alignment with CH3NH3PbI3. Consequently, they are successfully applied for perovskite solar cells based on copper doped nicklus oxide hole transfer layer, providing improved power conversion efficiency from 15.7% to near 18%. Detailed investigation shows that the performance improvement arises from enhanced charge extraction between hole transfer layer and perovskite. This study surely paves the way for the application of antimonene oxide based low dimensional materials in photovoltaic devices.",

However, these additives are often photochemically unstable. Attempts to improve the delicate performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by these additives are unimpressive. Here, we use an organic small-molecule semiconductor with unique photochemical stability, 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (Pc), to decorate perovskite/hole transfer layer interface. Pc molecules are observed to be located in the perovskite shallow layer and probably at perovskite grain boundaries. PSCs with moderate Pc decoration show mean and best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.3% and 19.8%, respectively, compared to 17.5% and 18.5% for the control. The PCE decay of the best PSC with moderate Pc is less than 10% of the initial PCE, and almost 30% for the best control under 500\u202fh continuous illumination and ambient atmosphere (~30% humidity). The photovoltaic performance enhancement induced by Pc decoration is ascribed to the decreased perovskite hole trap state density (from 2.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f1016 to 1.11\u202f\u00d7\u202f1016\u202fcm\u22123), the increased perovskite hole mobility (from 7.73\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123 to 1.22\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122 cm2V\u22121s\u22121), improved charge carrier transfer and extraction, and partially sealed channels to impede moisture diffusion.",

However, CsPbBr3 perovskite always suffers from a poor crystallinity and film morphology. Many efforts have been paid on the CsBr deposition process to improve the film quality, while few attentions are paid on the crystallization kinetics of the PbBr2 framework film. Here, we demonstrate a novel antisolvent-washing strategy for the PbBr2 film for the first time to fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 film. This technique has a significant impact on the nucleation and growth of PbBr2 crystals. As-prepared CsPbBr3 films exhibit more homogeneous with higher crystallinity and coverage as well as larger grain sizes compared to those untreated ones. The best-performing antisolvent-treated perovskite solar cell achieves a scanned power conversion efficiency of 8.55%, which is an excellent efficiency for planar CsPbBr3 cells reported yet. This enhancement can be mainly attributed to the more effective charge transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination caused by the reduced defect densities. Moreover, our devices show superb stability when stored in air for 1000\u202fh and upon persistent thermal attack at 80\u202f\u00b0C.

Here, we develop an annealing-free, dopant-free, and amorphous tungsten oxide as electron transport layer by vacuum evaporation for flexible perovskite solar cells. The compact amorphous tungsten oxide electron transport layer with different thicknesses (0\u201350\u202fnm) was directly deposited on flexible PEN/ITO substrate. A model of the improvement mechanism is proposed to understand how the thickness tailoring simultaneously enhances the crystallization and relaxes the trade-off between interface recombination and charge transfer. By optimizing the amorphous tungsten oxide thickness, the high homogeneous, uniform, and dense electron transport layer with a thickness of 30\u202fnm is found to not only decrease the pinhole of the perovskite layer, but also enhance charge transport with reducing resistance. Furthermore, the mechanical bending stability revealed that, the fabricated perovskite solar cells show stable power conversion efficiency up to more than 1000 bending cycles. The room-temperature processed fabrication enables the amorphous tungsten oxide to become a potential electron transport layer candidate for the large-scale flexible perovskite solar cells, which becomes compatible with practical roll-to-roll solar cells manufacturing.",

Characterizations such as current density - voltage, electron microscopy (SEM, c-AFM, KPFM) and space-charge limited current\u2013voltage (SCLC) measurements have been conducted for investigating the mechanism behind. The superior performance of SCN\u2212 assisted perovskite is owning to enlarged grain interiors as well as passivated grain boundaries, which attributed to the reduced current leakage, enhanced charge transport characteristics, and less trap-assisted interfacial recombination in the device.",

However, Sn perovskites previously reported are narrow-bandgap materials. Wide-bandgap perovskites, which are the key materials for the top layer of lead-free tandem solar cells, are rarely researched up to now. Here, it is demonstrated that optoelectronic properties of the GA0.06(FA0.8Cs0.2)0.94SnI2Br based wide-bandgap perovskite can be improved by exploring (1) Germanium (II) Iodide (GeI2) doping, (2) incorporation of Ethylenediamine Bromide (EDABr2) at A site, (3) EDA passivation. The incorporation of big organic cation EDABr2 in the wide-bandgap tin perovskite crystal structure together with GeI2 doping made the carrier lifetime of perovskite absorber increase from 1.1 ns to 22.8 ns and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced from 2.55% to 4.86% with an increment of Voc \u02c3 100\u00a0mV. Further, we achieved the balanced charge transfer by using EDA passivation on the optimized perovskite surface film. As a result, the efficiency was improved from 4.86% to 7.50%, which is the highest efficiency among lead-free wide bandgap PSCs. This enhanced photovoltaic performance of the wide-bandgap tin perovskite device presents a wide application in lead-free tandem towards commercial development.",

        "abstract": "High-temperature preparation of metal oxide-based electron transporting materials is considered to be a potential obstacle toward the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Inverted perovskite solar cells can overcome this problem by employing metal-oxide free, low-temperature-fabricated, and solution-processed electron transporting materials. However, the conventionally-used electron transporting materials (e.g. phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) has several drawbacks including poor morphology control and high cost, which make its application impractical. Thus, scientists are actively searching novel organic small molecules to replace PCBM because these small compounds have tunable frontier molecular orbitals as well as good film morphology control. More importantly, these molecules can be prepared through inexpensive synthesis routes. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based electron transporting materials (4,4\u2032-(piperazine-1,4-diyl)bis(2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn]-[3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2\u202fH,7\u202fH)-tetraone) (PDPT) and 9,9\u2032-(piperazine-1,4-diyl) bis(4-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-2,7 dioctylbenzo [lmn]-[3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2\u202fH,7\u202fH)-tetraone) (PMDPT)), and found that the inverted perovskite solar cells with PMDPT as an electron transporting layer can reach a power conversion efficiency up to 9.2% while the efficiency of PSCs based on PDPT can only approach 7.6%. We believe that this improvement in the efficiency of PMDPT-based PSCs ascribes to the increased number of nitrogen atoms in the framework of PMDPT, which passivates the electron trap centers on the surface of the perovskite layer. This passivation results in less charge recombination, therefore delivering a higher Voc and PCE.",

Here, the pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 layer with high coverage and smooth surface is prepared by the one-step solution method in air with ethylacetate as anti-solvent on an electron transport hybrid layer of TiO2 nanoparticles coated porous carbon. The effect of ethylacetate as anti-solvent on the quality of perovskite thin film is studied in detail by comparing with chlorobenzene and ethylether. The high saturation and humidity resistance of ethylacetate in air control the nucleation and growing kinetics of perovskite crystals during the spin coating process, which facilitates the formation of uniform pinhole-free perovskite thin films.

This paper focuses on the ETL composed of titanium dioxide deposited by sol-gel method. In particular, perovskite solar cells with ETL from aged titanium sol revealed significant differences of short circuit current which is 8% higher than their counterpart with ETL from fresh sol. Analysis of ETL morphology by atomic force microscopy combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and optical properties measurements enabled to determine the source of this diversity. Additionally, the role of roughness of transparent electrode was indicated. The in-depth material analysis revealed some disadvantages of the ETL material, originally considered as supporting higher photovoltaic performance. The results indicated several problems associated with hardly controlled aging conditions, defects and presence of residual water, strongly advocate for TiO2 ETL form the fresh sol, which after optimization can guarantee the same good solar cell performance.",

The structural analysis confirms the existence of nickel sulphide (NiS) crystalline phase composed of small-sized crystallites. The optimal bandgap values of the prepared perovskite (1.51\u202feV) and NiS (3.71\u202feV) materials found to be favorable in achieving the active absorbing and hole extraction properties in PSCs. The surface morphology of the nickel sulphide materials is found to be highly dependent on the NiS-carbon composition. The current density-voltage (J-V) results of the fabricated perovskite solar cells with nickel sulphide-carbon composite hole transporting layer (HTL) suggests that incorporation of commercial carbon paste into the nickel sulphide nanoparticles tends to promote the charge carrier transporting ability and resulted in yielding high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.20%, when compared to that of the bare NiS (1.87%). The results show that this nickel sulphide-carbon composite can serve as an efficient dual role as an HTL to transport holes and as a conductive counter electrode for the planar heterojunction PSCs with the structure FTO/compact-TiO2/porous-TiO2/perovskite/NiS-carbon. So, nickel sulphide-carbon composite can be considered as an efficient replacement for the other unstable HTMs and high-cost metal counter electrodes used in PSCs.",

Although studies on upscaling of PSC technology for practical applications are growing, operation stability remains a challenge and need to be addressed. Ingress of ambient moisture into the device architecture and subsequent decomposition of organometal halide perovskite absorber is identified as one of the major reason for poor operational stability of PSCs. In this letter, we report a low temperature glass-to-glass encapsulation of PSCs using ultraviolet (UV) light curable epoxy edge sealant. Controlled UV irradiation induces epoxy cross-linking and hermitic glass-to-glass encapsulation at <50\u202f\u00b0C and therefore device retains 85% of its original performance. Nevertheless, conventional encapsulation carried out using surlyn thermoplastic gasket at 120\u202f\u00b0C decreased the device\u2019s original performance by about 25%. Preliminary stability studies carried out by aging the PSCs at 30\u202f\u00b0C, 50% humidity show that UV cured epoxy edge sealing effectively prevent the moisture ingress and thus improve the device stability beyond 70\u202fdays.",

        "abstract": "The stability of perovskite solar cells is a key issue for industrial development. One reason for this is the volatile organic methylammonium (MA) cation, which is prone to degas under elevated temperatures from the perovskite. At the same time, small amounts of MA are used for practically all highest performing solar cells. These compositions have also shown relatively promising stabilities. This raises the question of MA stability with respect to different, application-dependent stability requirements. Interestingly, MA stability was mainly studied on thin films that differ from full devices or with architectures which are also prone to degrade. Therefore, the degradation behavior on complete MA containing devices with a relatively stable architecture is required to quantify the long-term stability of MA. This enables to determine at which timescales MA is unstable and which role it can play in future compositions. If MA is indeed unstable at much longer timescales than previously recorded, it also indicates that more severe degradation pathways are currently underappreciated. Here, \u201cweakest link\u201d MAPbI3 solar cells show stability where devices retained 100% of their initial efficiency over 1000\u202fh of aging under constant illumination and maximum power point tracking at 20\u202f\u00b0C.

Thus, MA-containing devices require further studying.

Electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) indicated that this post-treatment process could enhance charge transfer at TiO2/perovskite interface. Finally, the conversion efficiency increased from 10.10% to 11.82%, 11.68%, and 10.66% using perovskite films post-treated by DMF/CBZ, DMSO/CBZ, and GBL/CBZ blend solvents, respectively.",

Investigations of the CL thickness-dependent current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics, dark current, and open circuit voltage (Voc) decays showed a similar trend for thickness dependence. A CL thickness of 90nm afforded the perovskite-based solar cell with the maximum power conversion efficiency (\u03b7, 3.17%). Furthermore, two additional devices, perovskite-based solar cell omitting hole transporting materials layer and cell without the TiO2 nanoparticles, were designed and fabricated to study the influence of the CL thickness on different electron transport paths in perovskite-based solar cells. Solar cells devoid of TiO2 nanoparticles, but with perovskite and organic hole-transport materials (HTMs), exhibited sustained improvement in photovoltaic performances with increase in the thickness of CL, which is in contrast to the behavior of classical perovskite-based solar cell and common solid state solar cell which showed optimal photovoltaic performances when the thickness of CL is 90nm. These observations suggested that TiO2 nanoparticles play a significant role in electron transport in perovskite-based solar cells.",

The fabricated optimized perovskite solar cell having Glass/FTO/mp-TiO2/MAPbI3-xClx/carbon\u00a0+\u00a0MAI/Carbon configuration exhibited \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a013.87% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with open circuit voltage (VOC) 0.997\u00a0V, current density (JSC)\u00a0=\u00a021.41\u00a0mAcm\u22122 and fill factor (FF) 0.65. Furthermore, the air stability were tested at room temperature in open atmosphere. The water proof stability was tested under water flushing. Our results revealed that, although our carbon based devices show lower PCE (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a013.87%) compared to spiro-MeOTAD HTM (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a015%), the fabricated PSCs could even retain >90% after water exposure >20 times and ambient air stability more than 160 days. Further the large area device (>1\u00a0cm2) device shows 13.04% PCE with Jsc\u00a0=\u00a021.47\u00a0mAcm\u22122, VOC\u00a0=\u00a00.996\u00a0V and FF\u00a0=\u00a00.61. We have also demonstrated >13% efficiency for large area device (>1.1\u00a0cm2), demonstrating that the developed method is simple, cost effective and promising towards large area device fabrication. The developed methodology based on low cost carbon hole extraction layer will be helpful towards waterproof and air stable perovskite solar cells for large-area devices.",

    "Rapid and low temperature processing of mesoporous TiO2 for perovskite solar cells on flexible and rigid substrates": {
        "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community because of the rapid advances in their development. Most of the state-of-the-art devices contain mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) as an electron transport layer. The drawback of such TiO2 layers is that it often needs high temperature sintering at 450\u2013500\u00b0C for 30min, which slows down the fabrication process and is clearly not compatible with future roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing.The aim of this study was to develop low temperature and rapid curing techniques for mesoporous TiO2 thin films, which are compatible with R2R processing and heat-sensitive plastic substrates for PSCs. Several alternative annealing techniques were tested on rigid and flexible substrates, such as UV-ozone (UV/O3) treatment, oxygen plasma treatment (O2 plasma) and Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) sintering and compared to conventional thermal annealing. After each treatment, the mesoporous layers were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Low temperature sintering techniques were specifically optimized for the mesoporous TiO2 layers and were adapted for the fabrication of PSCs. Sintering process and solar cells manufacturing were optimized for two different device architectures on glass as well as on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates. Moreover, the maximum temperature of the mesoporous TiO2 layer during the IPL curing process was simulated to better understand the curing process. By employing IPL curing, the processing time for the mesoporous TiO2 layer can be reduced from 30min to a few seconds without significant loss in the device performance. In particular stabilized PCE of 16% and 12% were obtained using IPL on glass and PEN substrates respectively. This processing route paves the way for future low temperature R2R processing of mesoscopic PSC on plastic substrates.",

In n\u2013i\u2013p-structured perovskite solar cells, various outstanding polymer materials have been successfully applied. However, in p\u2013i\u2013n-structured solar cells, the hydrophobic nature of the polymers makes the sequential deposition of a perovskite thin film difficult. Several destructive methods have been proposed; however, a more efficacious and fundamental method is urgently needed. Here, we present a nondestructive polymer hole-transporting layer (HTL) thin-film formation process based on molecular engineering via a simple solvent process. When we used various solvents with different volatilities, perovskite film formation was achieved on polymer thin films formed from highly volatile solvents. In addition, we elucidated the structure and orientation of the molecules in the films and revealed that the molecular structure of face-on orientation for the horizontally aligned hydrophobic alkyl groups induced a lower surface energy of the film, as determined by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. Furthermore, the tilt angle of the molecules, which was calculated from the results of quantitative near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) analysis, was found to correlate with the surface energy. This result provides guidance for polymer-orientation and surface-energy studies, and perovskite solar cells fabricated using the polymer HTL demonstrated good durability and flexibility.

        "abstract": "Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a highly promising alternative renewable energy source because of their high efficiency and low-cost solution processable manufacturing technology. However, the commonly used spin coating process limits the large-scale manufacturing of perovskite layers for commercialization. Here we report on the development of an electrodeposition technique for fabricating perovskite layers and demonstrate its simplicity, versatility, scalability and roll-to-roll manufacturing compatibility. The key step is the electrodeposition of a PbO2 layer on TiO2 scaffold, which is then subjected to chemical bath conversion to sequentially generate PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Clearly demonstrated is the controllability of morphology and optical properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) reproducibility and a higher average PCE when incorporated into carbon-based PSCs than with the spin coating technique. Remarkably, the cell area of electrodeposited PSCs could be easily scaled up to 4cm2 with an excellent perovskite film uniformity, rendering a PCE gain of 36.3% over the spin-coated counterpart. We further demonstrate the deposition of perovskite layers on complex shape substrates (e.g., stainless steel net), which would be rather difficult or impossible with other competing film deposition techniques. These results establish electrodeposition as a versatile and controllable route toward low-cost and large scalable manufacturing of high efficiency PSCs.",

We unraveled that such dual compositional tuning in perovskite can improve the crystallinity of the resultant film and thus reduce its density of defect states as evidenced by admittance spectroscopy, resulting in a prolonged carrier lifetime over 500ns. As a result, a promising average PCE (PCEAVG) of 17.34% was realized in the optimized MA0.7FA0.3Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3-based PVSC with little hysteresis and stable photocurrent output.

Although the processing of perovskite films with electron-rich molecules that can efficiently passivate the surface traps, the exact mechanism remains unclear. As the electron-rich units are key components for such a function, a rigorous analysis using controlled electron density in passivators can provide the means to understand these underlying mechanisms and thereby improve future improvements. In the study reported here, we combined electron-rich functional groups with fullerenes to design a new series of hydrophilic fullerene derivatives, in which each phenyl group of the diphenylmethanofullerene (DPM) moiety was decorated with an oligoether (OE) side group. These new materials were introduced as alternative electron transport layers (ETLs) to replace the commonly used PCBM in p-i-n planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Our tests indicate that electron-rich OE chains can both passivate perovskite trap states and reduce the work function of the metal cathode. By adjusting the numbers of OE chains, relevant properties such as the energy levels, charge carrier mobilities, surface energy and dipole layer features could be tuned at the interfaces. Furthermore, devices with these fullerene ETLs showed significant improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to devices with PCBM ETLs.

In this paper, we validate a simple model to relate the scan rate-dependent hysteresis of the solar cells and the defect assisted ion migration in perovskite materials by means of halide substitution to form MAPbBrxI3\u2212x (x~0\u20130.6), prepared by a modified two-step method so as to put the systematic study at a high solar cell efficiency level. Concurrent with the substantially increased power conversion efficiency (PCE), significantly reduced hysteresis has also been observed with increasing Br concentration. Bias-dependent kinetic measurements suggest that the hysteresis is caused by the redistribution of mobile ions (ion migration) under external bias and light illumination, which could be suppressed by Br substitution. Our Density Functional Theory study has borne out this notion by showing that the activation energy for I\u2212 (mobile species) migration has been increased from ~0.34eV in MAPbI3 to ~0.46eV in MAPbBrxI3\u2212x.

In this work, we introduced CH3NH3Cl into the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 precursor for antisolvent precipitation at low temperature and fabricated high quality perovskite films with desired morphology, crystallinity and optical properties. The X-ray diffractometry and ultraviolent-visible spectroscopy provided ample evidence that CH3NH3Cl exerted significant impacts on the perovskite crystallization process by controlling the delivery speed of PbI2 from the intermediate phase CH3NH3PbI2Cl. The possible reactions in the perovskite formation process were first elaborated. The resultant solar cells demonstrated an average power conversion efficiency around 16.63% and a best efficiency at 17.22% under the standard light illumination condition. In addition, the ion migration was first detected in the perovskite solar cells by an ordinary impedance measurement.",

In addition, despite improved charge transfer was predicted for oriented film along <112>/<200> directions, the fabrication is still on the way and rarely reported. Herein, an ultra-smooth perovskite film oriented along <112>/<200> directions is created for the first time, with a homogeneous tetragonal phase of (MAPbI3)1\u2212x(CsPbBr3)x. The preferentially precipitated heavily Cs-doped perovskite, and the lowered surface energy of (112) and (200) planes, verified by DFT calculations, are responsible for the orientation. The improved charge transfer and suppressed trap states in the oriented film substantially improved the performance.

Highly crystalline TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) stabilized with oleic acid are synthesized and the highly dispersed TiO2 NCs solution is spin-coated, followed by UV treatment. The UV exposure induces photocatalytic removal of the organic ligands and spontaneous coalescence of the TiO2 NCs, resulting in highly uniform and compact TiO2 thin films. The UV-processed TiO2 layer (UV-TiO2) shows higher transmittance and a better blocking effect, compared to a conventional TiO2 layer (HT-TiO2) prepared by high temperature sintering process. Furthermore, Nb doping of the TiO2 NCs improves the electrical conductivity and gives rise to a downward shift of the conduction band, enhancing the charge extraction. Thanks to the advantages, PSCs based on UV-Nb:TiO2 ESLs show improved photovoltaic performances and less hysteresis, compared to the HT-TiO2 ESL.

With the device structure of FTO/NiOx/MAPbI3/ETM/Ag, the C5-NCMA showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 17.6% with negligible hysteresis, which is higher than PCBM (16.1%). It was found that a higher LUMO energy level was obtained for C5-NCMA compared to PCBM, which favored a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PVSCs with C5-NCMA than PCBM. Besides, the higher electron mobility, photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency and quenching rate of C5-NCMA led to more efficient electron transport and charge extraction in the device, thus resulting in a higher fill factor (0.79). Most importantly, the stability of PVSCs to moisture is significantly enhanced for C5-NCMA compared to PCBM due to the hydrophobic nature of C5-NCMA.

The hybrid fluoroalkyl-substituted fullerene, DF-C60, is proven to effectively passivate the defects and grain boundaries in the perovskite film to facilitate charge transport/collection in the derived PVSC. Consequently, the f-FPHJ device yielded an enhanced PCE of 18.11%, outperforming that of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 device (15.67%). More interestingly, the f-FPHJ PVSC showed a decent PCE of 15.14% (under reverse scan) with small hysteresis even without employing a discrete PCBM electron-transporting layer (ETL), in contrast to the pristine PVSC showing a lower PCE of 14.78% (under reverse scan) accompanied with severe hysteresis. This might arise from the preferential distribution of DF-C60 nearby the surface region of the f-FPHJ film due to its low surface energy, which serves the similar function of the PCBM ETL in device to reduce hysteresis. More importantly, benefitting from the hydrophobic nature of DF-C60, the f-FPHJ PVSC shows respectable ambient stability without encapsulation, which can maintain 83% of its initial PCE after being stored in ambient (with a relative humidity of 60\u00b15%) for 1 month.",

However, the production of high quality and defect-free very thin films of perovskites in an all low temperature solution processed p-i-n type device structure has been elusive due to the sensitivity of the materials crystallization dynamics and the variability of surface specific interactions. Here, we show that a unique surface passivation method based on thiourea vapor treatment can effectively produce high quality CH3NH3PbI3 thin-films up to 110nm of thickness on top of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) surface.

        "abstract": "Solvent engineering has been extensively used to control the growth of a high-quality perovskite layer for solar cells by forming intermediate phases. However, the intermediate phase formation is often poorly understood and its effects on the perovskite layer growth are still elusive. Here, we have conducted a systematic and in-depth study on the above two issues through a strict control over the DMSO/DMF ratio in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solutions, and thus an effective control over the compositions of intermediate films. The films thus obtained, including perovskite, perovskite/MA2Pb3I8(DMSO)2 and MA2Pb3I8(DMSO)2, afford perovskite crystals via down-growth, down-and up-growth, and up-growth mechanisms, respectively. Significantly, the up-growth perovskite crystals from the pure MA2Pb3I8(DMSO)2 exhibits the best interface contact with NiO substrate, optimal alignment without horizontal grain boundaries and a relatively large grain size, which facilitate charge transfer and reduce charge recombination in PSCs. As a result, the PIN planar PSCs based on NiO have achieved a PCE of 18.4%, a value which is among the highest for NiO-based PSCs, with the highest stability among the tested sample cells. Furthermore, the pure MA2Pb3I8(DMSO)2 intermediate phase presents a high long-term stability, which enlarges the operating window for perovskite deposition and thus considerably improves the device processibility.",

The vigorous progress made recently for tin (Sn)- and Pb/Sn-based PVSCs has drawn considerable attention because of their potential to reduce Pb content in perovskites. However, the inferior chemical stability of Sn to Pb element necessitates more sophisticated morphological and processing engineering of Sn-containing PVSCs in order to achieve high performance and stability. We have recently discovered that ascorbic acid (AA) can serve as a simple but effective additive to simultaneously enhance the performance and stability of Sn-containing PVSCs. It is revealed that AA as a commonly known antioxidant can retard the oxidation of Sn-containing precursor solution of perovskite while modulate its perovskite crystallization by forming intermediate complexes. This is evidenced by the prolonged photogenerated carrier lifetime (182.7ns) of its derived MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 film. As a result, a high PCE of 14.01% with improved stability can be realized in the binary metal PVSC with AA as additive, outperforming the value (12.18%) of the control device processed with the regular SnF2 additive.",

In comparison, PSCs based on TiO2 ETL showed a much lower PCE of 15.70%. Experimental results clearly illustrate that the optimized band structure, enhanced light tapping and low recombination of photo-generated carriers in In2S3 ETL based devices leads to this enhanced performance.

In order to advance the deployment of PSCs, fabrication of high-quality perovskite film using a facile and sustainable process is essential. This study provides significant breakthrough in this direction. A novel fabrication process is demonstrated that allows slicing of 2D layers from single crystals and restacking them to fabricate high-quality perovskite film. The discovery that CH3NH2 can slice the 3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal into 2D layered perovskite intermediates via intercalation process opens a new pathway for pursuing synthesis of a variety of photovoltaic materials. The 2D layered intermediate shows high solubility in acetonitrile (ACN) solvent, which is considered as a replacement for N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in order to enable sustainable processing. This solvent system enables fabrication of high-quality perovskite layer by one-step synthesis method.

The suitable addition of nickel (Ni) dopant could enhance the electron conductivity as well as induce downward shift of the conduction band minimum for \u03b1-Fe2O3, which facilitate electrons injection and transfer from the conduction band of the perovskite. As a consequence, a substantial reduction in the charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface makes the device much less sensitive to scanning rate and direction, i.e., lower hysteresis. With a reverse scan for the optimized PSC under standard AM-1.5 sunlight illumination, it generates a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2% with a large short circuit current (Jsc) of 22.35mA/cm2, an open circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.92V and a fill factor (FF) of 69.1%.

        "abstract": "Organo-metal halide perovskites, as emerging photovoltaic materials, have demonstrated interesting spin states due to spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects. However, replacing the Pb with the Sn can inevitably affect the SOC and consequently changes the internal photovoltaic processes in the development of environmentally friendly perovskite devices. Here, by operating the spin states with circularly polarized photoexcitation we report that the spin-dependent photocurrent (Jsc) becomes much more prominent upon replacing Pb with Sn, increasing the spin dependence from 0.25% to 1.25% by switching the photoexcitation from linear to circular polarization. Essentially, the spin-dependent Jsc is determined by the spin relaxation time, changing with the SOC strength, as compared to the charge dissociation time. On the other hand, our magneto-photocurrent (magneto-Jsc) results show that the internal magnetic parameter decreases from 281mT to 41mT upon Sn-Pb replacement, providing an evidence that the SOC is indeed weakened from Pb to Sn based solar cells. Furthermore, the spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) indicates that weakening the SOC upon the Sn-Pb replacement leads to more antiparallel spin states (singlets) available for PL but less parallel spin states (triplets) available for photovoltaic action. Therefore, SOC plays an important role in the development of photovoltaic actions in Sn-based perovskite solar cells.",

The carbon counter electrode based PSC owns a good prospect in development and commercialization, whereas photo-thermal effects induced thermal degradation will be more crucial due to notable photo-thermal conversion of the carbon. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs will decline when the temperature increases and recover when decreasing. After integration with TEs, the carbon electrodes can act as the infrared light absorption layer for the TEs, which improve the photo-thermal ability and triple the output voltage of the thermoelectric devices, substantially compensating the thermal degradation of the PSCs. Electrical measurements reveal that the integrated devices exhibit much higher and more stable energy output. When tested in ambient air, the hybrid device exhibits obvious enhancement: the overall conversion efficiency increases from 9.88% to 12.6% after integration. When the cold side of the TE part is cooled by ice bath, the hybridization obtains a maximum VOC of 1.87V under AM 1.5G illumination with a temperature gradient of 15\u00b0C, boosts a more than 124% increase of the photo-electric conversion efficiency (PCE), from 9.88% (photovoltaic) to 22.2% (photovoltaic-thermoelectric), and gets a higher maximum power output of 22.2mWcm\u22122.

        "abstract": "Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite has become one of the most attractive materials for future low-cost high-efficiency solar technology. However, the polycrystalline nature of perovskite thin-film often possesses an exceptional density of defects, especially at grain boundaries (GBs) and film surface, limiting further improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite device. Here, we report a simple method to reduce GBs and to passivate the surface of a methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3) film by guanidinium thiocyanate (GUTS)-assisted Ostwald ripening post treatment. High-optoelectronic quality MAPbI3 film consisting of micron-sized grains were synthesized by post-treating a MAPbI3 film with GUTS/isopropanol solution (4mg/mL, GUTS-4). Analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the solar cells showed that interfacial charge recombination resistance of the device based on a GUTS-4 post-treated MAPbI3 absorber film was increased by a factor of 1.15\u20132.6, depending on light illumination intensity, compared to the control MAPbI3 cell. This is consistent with results of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay and the light intensity dependent photovoltage evolution which shows device with GUTS treatment had one order longer charge carrier lifetime and was more ideal (ideality factor = 1.25). Further characterization by Kelvin probe force microscope indicated that GUTS-4 treatment shifted the energetics of the MAPbI3 film by ~ 100meV towards better energy level alignment with adjacent SnO2 electron transport layer, leading to a more favorable charge extraction process at the MAPbI3/SnO2 interface. As a result, the PCE of PSCs was enhanced from 14.59% to 16.37% and the hysteresis effect was mitigated.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the low-energy sunlight harvesting is of great importance for improving the efficiency of organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) but still remains a big challenge. Herein, we propose an improved light harvesting and management strategy by using rationally-designed Au@Ag core-shell nanocuboids as plasmonic inclusions, aiming at achieving panchromatic thin PSCs. Compared to conventional metal nanostructures with a single narrow plasmon resonance band, the Au@Ag nanocuboids exhibit multiple broader and stronger plasmon resonances that can be tuned by adjusting structural dimensions to spectrally match the absorption band of the perovskite, particularly in its weak absorption region. By carefully tailoring the location of the Au@Ag nanocuboids in the electrodes, both plasmonic near-field enhancement and increased light-scattering effects can be fully exploited to boost up the performance of the PSCs. As a result, the hybrid devices demonstrate high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) over the entire visible range, with a remarkable IPCE enhancement (\u0394IPCE/IPCE) of 20\u201360% in the range of 550\u2013750nm, compared with pristine devices. This also leads to an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.83% for the optimized Au@Ag incorporated cells, with a champion PCE of 18.31% recorded for the best plasmonic PSC, corresponding to a PCE enhancement of 20.8%.",

Here, we report an excellent electron-transporting layer (ETL) that can simultaneously enhance the stability and efficiency of n-i-p planar PSCs. Large \u03c0-conjugated graphdiyne (GD) was introduced into cross-linkable fullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD) to improve the film orientation. Raman spectroscopy and 2D grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements revealed that a strong \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction occurred between GD and cross-linkable PCBSD (C-PCBSD), generating a face-on stacked composite film. The orientated C-PCBSD:GD films was favorable for the growth and crystallization of the subsequent perovskite films and provided the merits of superior electron mobility, efficient charge extraction and energy-level tailoring. In addition, the thermally annealed C-PCBSD:GD film provided an adhesive film network with sufficient solvent resistance. Consequently, the perovskite devices delivered a power conversion efficiency of 20.19% with obviously improved cell stability. This indicates a potential application of GD-modified cross-linkable fullerene as an ETL in n-i-p structure PSCs. The finding opens a new route to deposit the fullerene films with ordered orientation by 2D materials with large \u03c0-conjugation, and thus to control the subsequent perovskite crystallization.",

Then, we correlate the nanoscale pcAFM and PL analysis to the macroscopic device behaviour in similar ageing condition. We found that non-reversible performance losses in a complete device originate from degradation localised at the grain boundaries of the perovskite film. Interesting, within the bulk of the perovskite grains we observed fully reversible behaviours. We conclude that the grain boundaries are detrimental to the device stability and they need to be minimized or passivated to achieve fully stable perovskite solar cells even under anhydrous conditions.",

The X-ray diffraction results suggested that the lattice constant of the perovskites incorporating Li+, Na+ or K+ is larger than that of the perovskite without incorporation, while the incorporation of Rb+ or Cs+ did not change the lattice constant. The incorporation of Li+, Na+ or K+ resulted in a red shift in absorption edge, whereas the incorporation of Rb+ or Cs+ caused a blue shift. The identical trend was also found in the photoluminescence spectra, indicating the modification of the band gap by the alkali cations. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of the perovskites containing Li+, Na+ or K+ were upshifted, while those were downshifted in the Cs+ case. The assessments of the carrier lifetime and the defect revealed that the K+ containing perovskite had the least defect, followed by the perovskites containing Rb+, Cs+ and Na+. In addition to the barrier at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, the defects in perovskites played a crucial role in hysteresis in the current versus voltage curves. Consequently, the efficiency of more than 20% with negligible hysteresis was achieved in K+ containing perovskite solar cells.",

The thin MgO overlayer leads to more uniform films, reduces interfacial carrier recombination, and leads to better stability. All layers of the cells, except for the two electrodes, are solution processed at low temperatures for low cost processing. Furthermore, ambient indoor conditions represent a milder environment compared to stringent outdoor conditions for a technology that is still looking for a commercial outlet also due to stability concerns. The unparalleled performance here demonstrated, paves the way for perovskite solar cells to contribute strongly to the powering of the indoor electronics of the future (e.g. smart autonomous indoor wireless sensor networks, internet of things etc).",

Flexible PSCs are generally realized on small areas (<\u202f0.2\u202fcm2), far from technology commercialization where modules-scale is necessary. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient n-i-p PSCs grown on flexible substrates by proper interface engineering for improved electron extraction. We compared spin coated PEIE and vacuum deposited LiF as interlayers between Al-doped ZnO, as transport conductive oxide (TCO), and thermally evaporated C60, as electron transport layer (ETL). Once interlayers are applied, we observed a favorable band bending at TCO interface which results in enhanced charge extraction and lower recombination losses. We achieved flexible PSCs with stabilized efficiencies of 14.8%, both with PEIE and LiF interfacial modifications.In addition, we developed a flexible perovskite mini-module with stabilized efficiency of 10.5% onto an aperture area larger than 10\u202fcm2. The monolithic interconnections are entirely obtained by highly accurate and reliable laser scribing methods. A geometric fill factor as high as ~\u202f94% is achieved, with a dead area width of ~\u202f250\u202f\u00b5m.",

However, the toxicity of lead remains a concern for the further application and commercialization of this technology. Therefore, it is desirable to explore efficient lead-free PSCs. Here in the tin-based inverted PSCs, we introduced an ultrathin low-dimensional perovskite (LDP) interlayer close to the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. The LDP structure advantageously assists the growth of perovskites close to the interface, resulting in improved film morphology and reduced trap states. We demonstrated that the trap passivation could effectively suppress charge carrier accumulation and recombination in the device. As a consequence, a champion power conversion efficiency of 7.05% was achieved, which is one of the highest reported efficiencies for the lead-free formamidinium tin iodide PSCs.

However, compositional diversity of multi-component perovskites is significantly hampered due to the poor solubility of other cesium halides in these solvents. Here, we show how insoluble CsCl, as a new source of cesium cation, can be integrated into a multiple-cation perovskite material by a one-step method involving grinding of the precursors. The resulting polycrystalline powder is fully soluble in a DMSO/DMF mixture and allows formation of perovskite thin films. 133Cs solid-state MAS NMR data indicate that the cesium cation is almost fully (90%) incorporated into the 3D perovskite lattice, while the remaining 10% forms a cesium-rich mixed-halide secondary phase. The planar heterojunction device fabricated using this original mechanoperovskite yielded a power conversion efficiency of 19.12% and an open circuit voltage of 1.16\u202fV.

However, carbon-based PSCs always suffer from much lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the counterparts with noble metal cathode. Herein, we demonstrate a carbon-based planar heterojunction PSC using high-crystallinity Ni-doped rutile TiO2 as electron transport layer (ETL) for the first time, while copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is introduced as hole transport layer (HTL). It is found that Ni doping can shift the Fermi level of the ETL upward and increase the charge mobility of the TiO2 film, thus enhancing the charge transport and extraction. An optimized PCE of 17.46% was obtained after 0.01\u202fM Ni doping, comparable to or even better than devices with state-of-the-art doped Spiro-OMeTAD as HTL and Au as CE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency that has been reported for carbon-based PSCs. By contrast, the pristine TiO2-based device only displayed a PCE of 15.82%. Detailed superior capability of Ni-doped TiO2 in facilitating charge transfer and suppressing carrier recombination are revealed by Hall effect and photoluminescence (PL) as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Furthermore, the use of highly stable CuPc and commercial carbon makes as-prepared PSCs exhibit excellent stability with no obvious decline in PCE after being stored in ambient air for 1200\u202fh.

Introducing a photoluminescent conversion layer by converting NIR or UV light into visible which can be effectively utilized by perovskite photoactive layer has been considered as a very promising route. In this work, on the basis of a novel NiO/Ag/NiO transparent electrode, the NaYF4: Yb3+, Er3+/NaYF4: Yb3+, Tm3+/Ag composite layers were introduced on the backlight side of the PSCs device by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD). This design enables multi-functional effects, harvesting NIR light and converting to visible, plasmonic scattering, reflection and luminescent enhancement. In this device, we observed considerable enhancement of PCE depending strongly on the power density of sunlight. Simultaneously, acting as an efficient encapsulation layer, the device also greatly boosted the long-term stability of PSCs in ambient conditions. Furthermore, a typical UV to visible Eu(TTA)2(Phen)MAA down-conversion (DC) layer was introduced on the incident light side of PSCs, leading to improvement of PCE and light stability of PSCs. Overall, the upconversion (UC) and DC effects give rise to the highest PCE performance of 19.5% and noticeable current density (Jsc) value of 27.1\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 among the reported transparent PSCs, suggesting the great potential for application in spectral broadening and stability enhancement of PSCs.",

In this study, perovskite materials with two different morphologies, compact (c-perovskite) and nanowires (nw-perovskite), were prepared with a simple two-step spin coating solution process and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. We found that the presence of partially grown perovskite nanowires in the photoactive layer results in an excellent photovoltaic performance, i.e. a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%. The shape and size of the perovskite nanowires are controlled by varying the concentration of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution and keeping constant all other processing parameters such as the spin-coating speed and the annealing temperature. The optimal nw-perovskite film exhibits better light harvesting properties in the visible region, improved charge separation, and high charge carrier mobility. The mechanisms of charge carrier transfer in the two type of perovskites and their recombination dynamics were investigated by performing time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements respectively. Further, with an additional approach, the morphologies and solar cell performances of the c-perovskite and nw-perovskite films are improved by the addition of a fullerene derivative (PC60BM). These morphological advantages, together with the significant suppression of hysteresis effects, mean that the nw-perovskite:PC60BM photoactive film could be useful in the fabrication of high-performance PSCs.",

The investigation into the influence of the GNR content within ETL on device performance demonstrated that excessive GNRs are detrimental for charge transfer as they block the contact between TiO2 and perovskite. In contrast to devices using pure TiO2 as ETL with a PCE of 15.87%, the PSCs employing GNRs-incorporated ETL display the improved photovoltaic performance with a highest PCE of 17.69%, a steady-state efficiency output of 17.05%, and a reduced current-voltage hysteresis. Subsequently, a systematic photo-carrier dynamics study revealed that the performance enhancement was a direct consequence of (a) the promoted fill factor and open circuit voltage due to the improved electron diffusion coefficient and the longer charge recombination time, (b) the increased charge collection efficiency owing to the cascade charge transfer from TiO2 to GNRs to FTO electrode, resulting in a higher external quantum efficiency and thus a larger short circuit current density and (c) the suppressed current-voltage hysteresis ascribed to the increased charge transfer noted above.

In-depth analysis of evolutions in morphology, chemical composition, dynamic and electronic structure of the perovskite layer at the nanometer scales indicates that it is initial dangling bonds and vacancies on the imperfect surfaces decrease the activation energy and cause the perovskite decomposition in a layer-by-layer pathway sequentially from the film surface to bulk.

However, this remains challenging due to expensive metal electrodes and organic hole-transporting materials (OHTMs) typically used in PSCs. By simplifying the device structure, OHTMs-free and noble metal-electrodes-free planar PSCs with the aperture area of 1\u202fcm2 are fabricated with novel NiO@CSs-composite electrodes. The distribution of hole-accepting nickel oxide (NiO) as closely-packed shells on the core carbon spheres (CSs) in the rambutan-like NiO@CSs-composite enhances the photogenerated hole collection efficiency and reduces recombination loss. The small porosity of this composite inhibits the intrusion of the oxygen/moisture through the counter electrode, thus enabling a stable device's efficiency of 11.70% up to 1500\u202fh under 40\u201360% humidity without encapsulation.

The power conversion efficiency over 14% was recently achieved since the initial demonstration of LDRP perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in 2014. However, further improvements require a fundamental understanding on the components functionality in LDRP perovskites, e.g., bulky organic ammonium spacer and halogen ions, which are critical for designing efficient LDRP PSCs. Here, we report the critical role of the chloride that are derived from halogenated organic ammonium salts on the LDRP perovskite film crystallization, growth, opto-electric properties, and device performance. We found that the expected improvements in perovskite morphology with increased grain size, enhanced crystallinity, and uniform and smooth surface were revealed no matter which introduced chloride either by bulky organic ammonium or methyl ammonium salts. We also unambiguously demonstrated that photocurrent and photovoltage of LDRP PSCs are highly related to the position of chloride on organic ammonium salts. Moreover, the films and devices maintain excellent stability by the introduction of chloride due to the excellent film quality. The resulting LDRP PSCs exhibited best efficiency of 12.78%, which is two times enhancement compared to all iodide-contained device (6.52%) commonly used in previous reports. These findings demonstrated that chloride plays a significant role in LDRP perovskite and detected a key parameter for the development of future LDRP perovskite absorbers and relevant optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "All-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attentions in the photovoltaic field these days in view of their outstanding stability, especially thermal stability. However, the bromide-rich perovskite, such as CsPbBr3, always suffer from a low phase-purity and poor morphology synthesized by traditional two-step deposition route. Herein, we demonstrate a facile multistep spin-coating strategy to fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 films on the low-temperature processed compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) of the carbon-based PSCs. As-prepared films exhibit more homogeneous with higher CsPbBr3-phase purity and larger average grain sizes up to 1\u202f\u00b5m, compared to those prepared through traditional two-step deposition process. The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the planar CsPbBr3 PSC is boosted from 7.05% to 8.12%, getting an increase by 15.2%, due to the increased crystallinity and light-harvesting ability as well as reduced trap states of the CsPbBr3 film. To further enhance the device performance, a SnO2 thin layer with much higher carrier mobility than TiO2 is introduced to passivate the c-TiO2 ETL. It is found that the SnO2 layer can not only improve the surface morphology of the ETL, but also reduce the current shunting pathways in the c-TiO2. The TiO2/SnO2 bilayered ETL possesses a superior electron extraction capability, beneficial to the charge transport and suppression of the interfacial trap-assisted recombination. The best-performing TiO2/SnO2-based CsPbBr3 PSC delivers an excellent fill factor of 0.817 and a high PCE of 8.79%, which is the highest efficiency for planar CsPbBr3 PSCs reported to date. More importantly, the unencapsulated all-inorganic PSCs show a promising humidity and thermal stability with no decline in efficiency when stored in ambient air at room temperature (25\u202f\u00b0C) for over 1000\u202fh and 60\u202f\u00b0C for one month, respectively.

To solve the issues, here we report dopamine-capped TiO2 nanoparticles as ETL via chelating effect to improve interfacial binding with perovskite active layer. The introduction of dopamine can substantially reduce oxygen vacancies and suppress deep trap states within TiO2. In addition, the terminal amino groups in dopamine can passivate the uncoordinated Pb atoms and decrease the Pb-I/Br antisite defects on the interface of perovskite/TiO2. As an interfacial crosslinking agent, dopamine can not only reduce charge-accumulation and charge-recombination rate, but also increase charge-extraction efficiency at the TiO2 and perovskite interface. Based on the dopamine-capped TiO2 nanoparticles surface, the corresponding planner Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 PSCs deliver a power conversion efficiency of nearly 21% with negligible hysteresis. Moreover, unencapsulated devices retain 80% of their initial performance after 1200\u202fh operation under constant full-sun illumination in nitrogen atmosphere.

However, a clear understanding of the impact of these cations on the structure-function relationship in relation to the device performance is severely lacking. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of Rb+ and Cs+ on the carrier dynamics using transient optical spectroscopy and correlate with solar cell performance. Unlike Rb+, Cs+ integrates well with methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+) yielding increased perovskite grain size, longer charge carrier lifetimes and improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). Concomitant incorporation of Cs+/Rb+ cooperatively retards radiative recombination by ~60% in the quaternary-cation based perovskite system (RbCsMAFA) compared to the dual-cation MAFA samples. By suppressing the defect density, PCEs around 20% are obtained along with more balanced charge carrier diffusion length and comparable photoluminescence quantum yield in quaternary-cation perovskites. While the synergistic addition of Rb+ and Cs+ is attractive for controlling defects and recombination losses in efficient solar cells development, sole incorporation of Rb+ is still an engineering challenge.

Such flexible PSC-LIC module manages to deliver an overall efficiency of 8.41% and a high output voltage of 3\u202fV\u202fat a discharge current density of 0.1\u202fA\u202fg\u22121. It could still harvest a remarkable overall efficiency exceeding 6% even at the high current density of 1\u202fA\u202fg\u22121, outperforming state-of-the-art photo-charging power sources. Accordingly, thus-derived, self-powered strain sensor readily manifests precise and continuous data recording of physiological signals without any external power connections, thereby realizing the synergy of energy harvesting, storage, and utilization within one smart system. This multi-field-coupled, function-integrated platform is anticipated to offer significant benefits toward practical self-powered wearable electronics.",

    "Enhancing the crystallinity and perfecting the orientation of formamidinium tin iodide for highly efficient Sn-based perovskite solar cells": {
        "abstract": "Low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor reproducibility are among the main challenges for tin-based perovskite solar cells (HPSCs). The facile formation of tin vacancies and oxidation of the divalent tin cation during the thin film fabrication process are among the causes of these problems, because the tin perovskite layer then becomes p-doped, resulting in significant trap-assisted recombination losses in devices. In this paper, we demonstrate that increasing the crystallinity of the tin perovskite film is an effective way to address the open issues with Sn-based perovskites. We succeed in improving the crystallinity of the 3D formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) grains, increasing their size, and perfecting their orientation in the out-of-plane direction by incorporating ethylammonium iodide (EAI) into a 2D/3D tin perovskite film (where 2D is PEA2FASn2I7, PEA\u202f=\u202fphenylethylammonium). This leads to a decrease of traps and background charge carrier density, and therefore to decreased charge recombination losses in EAx2D/3D based devices, as compared not only to devices based on FASnI3 but also to those based on 2D/3D mixtures. As a consequence, devices using a perovskite layer with composition EA0.082D/3D exhibit much higher PCE (8.4%) and better reproducibility compared to devices based on mixed 2D/3D perovskites (7.7%) and 3D perovskite (4.7%).",

Here, we show the effect of selective contact on the power output change under mpp tracking, which closely correlates with the charge recombination dynamics with a time scale of minutes. The normal n-i-p cell architecture comprising cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD (doped by either Li-TFSI or Zn-TFSI2) and the inverted p-i-n structure, NiOx/perovskite/PCBM, are examined to investigate the specific effect of the nature of the interface on operational stability. The normal structure with Li-TFSI shows a gradual performance decrease at mpp owing to the enhanced recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the spiro-MeOTAD, becoming the dominant recombination process, although the bulk-related recombination is suppressed. On the other hand, the inverted structure demonstrates an improved photocurrent at mpp due to the effectively suppressed recombination both in bulk and at the interface. Remarkably, the deteriorating performance of the normal structure with Li-TFSI at mpp is successfully avoided by replacing Li-TFSI with Zn-TFSI2, leading even to an increased power output with stable performance at mpp.",

        "abstract": "All-inorganic Br-rich perovskite photovoltaics with excellent stability have gained ever-increasing attention despite their slightly lower efficiency. Nowadays, trace heteroatom substitution has become a plausible approach to optimize perovskite properties as well as device performance. However, the substitution is limited by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t, 0.8\u202f<\u202ft\u202f<\u202f1.0), leading to the situation that the alternative deviating from the Goldschmidt rule is always overlooked, let alone utilized to enhance performance. Given this, Ba(II) is partially substituted for Pb(II) in CsPbIBr2 to investigate how the dopants-induced deviation from the Goldschmidt rule would affect perovskite property. Intriguingly, the result verifies that Ba(II) enables increased the grain size and enhances the crystallinity of CsPbIBr2. As such, the trap state density is reduced and the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite is suppressed. These advantages bring about an increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ba(II)-doped devices to 10.51%, outperforming that (8.4%) of the pristine counterpart. In addition, the perovskite stability is immune to Ba(II) substitution, even though it inflates the perovskite crystal lattice. These findings indicate that the perovskite films are tolerant to homovalent heteroatoms with a larger radius, stimulating further development of perovskite substitution engineering.",

In addition, planar PeSCs and PeLEDs have similar device architecture. These aspects inspired us to fabricate a dual-functional device with both SC and LED functions, here termed a light-emitting perovskite solar cells (LEPeSCs). However, the absence of an effective fabrication method to control grain size, uniformity, grain boundaries, and coverage of perovskite film inevitably limits device performance of dual-functional LEPeSCs. Here, we have demonstrated an efficient dual-functional LEPeSCs with planar device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBrI2/PC61BM/Ca/Al, which is able to reversibly convert luminous energy to electric energy or electric energy to luminous energy in a single device. By developing a new soft-covered annealing method, we obtained optimized grain morphology with large grain size, high uniformity, and decreased grain boundaries, which is difficult to achieve with conventional fabrication methods. The LEPeSCs exhibits high performance in both PeSCs and PeLEDs modes, with power conversion efficiency of 14.02% in SC mode and bright red-light emission of 1710\u202fcd/cm2 at 4\u202fV in LED mode.",

Herein, we introduce potassium triiodide complex (KI3) as a novel additive to the perovskite precursor solution for gas-quenched PSCs. The resultant perovskite film exhibits broader spectral response, enhanced photoluminescence and prolonged carrier lifetime, due to halide exchange and defect passivation brought about by the I2 supplied by the KI3 complex. The champion device fabricated from precursor with mixed KI and KI3 additives delivered a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 21.2% with negligible hysteresis due to the presence of potassium salt. This efficiency is the highest for PSCs fabricated by gas-quenching. Moreover, the KI3 additive has substantially improved the stability of the precursor solution, allowing high performance devices to be fabricated with aged solution, which widens the process window for perovskite film deposition and lengthens the lifetime of precursors which are important prerequisites for large scale production of PSC.",

A detailed model for improving the mechanism is proposed to describe how the upgraded antisolvent enhances both the perovskite crystallization and passivates the under-coordinated Pb2+ dangling bond.

The photovoltaic market demands high-efficiency, high stability and low-cost fabrication of perovksite solar cells, especially stability to the humid environment for operation. Here, MAPbI3/agarose photoactive material for humid stable unencapsulated devices has been proposed. These solar cells have been operated in ambient humid environment without glove box, exhibiting efficiency up to 14.66% and retain 90% of its PCE after 1392\u202fh and 60% of initial PCE after 1972\u202fh in ambient humid environment (RH>70%) without encapsulation. FTIR and XPS measurements reveal two critical factors for the improved stability. The molecular level interactions between agarose and MAPbI3 passivates the grain boundaries of perovskite thus preventing its degradation. Moreover, the formation of Li+-agarose complex at the interface between perovskite layer and hole conductive layer, effectively prevents the water uptake of MAPbI3 layer. Both effects of passivation and minimization of hygroscopicity of LiTFSI by agarose lower the decomposition speed of perovskite, which obviously increases the power efficiency and stability of device.",

        "abstract": "Pd- or Pt-based precious catalysts (PPC) are considered to be the best candidates toward high performance directly ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) applications, owing to their high intrinsic activity for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). However, the current major barrier for their commercialization is incompletely oxidized intermediates (IOI, such as CO) that poison the catalysts to affect the durability of the cells. Meanwhile, deactivated PPC catalyst is difficult to be recycled, thus impairing the economic benefits for the commercial applications. Moreover, because of the side effects of additive corrosion and aging, the carbon and organic binders widely used in current catalyst design would make the interactions of the IOI more complex to accelerate activity loss. Here, we report a Pd/amorphous SrRuO3 (Pd/a-SrRuO3) hybrid film as a promising material to overcome these problems. Perovskite SrRuO3 can effectively generate oxygen-contains (*OH, *OOH) for intermediates oxidation, providing an ideal platform to promote self-cleaning of CO on Pd activity sites. On the other hand, in analogy to typical self-adapting effect of amorphous catalyst in oxygen reduction reaction process, metastable state of amorphous SrRuO3 in this work is expected to prolong the activity adaptation region at the initial stage of cycling. Furthermore, our conceptual framework of directly depositing Pd/a-SrRuO3 film on operational electrode provides an effective solution to avoid the side effects related with carbon and binders, leading to superior reactivation phenomena with 98% efficiency. As a result, our designed Pd/a-SrRuO3 hybrid film exhibits superior EOR activity (4.0 A mg-1 Pd), durability (i-t, 60,000s), self-adapting region (exceeding 400 cycles with ending activity of 3.0 A mg-1 Pd at 1000th cycle), and also a long-term operation (CP) up to 300,000s with 10 times reactivation. This demonstration of a Pd/Pt-based hybrid catalyst with dual-capability of self-cleaning and self-adapting characteristics is an important step towards the development of highly durable EOR catalysts, with an enormous potential to promote practical application of DEFC.",

In this work, we explore the effect of adding NH4Cl on crystallization process and optical properties of perovskite. With adding NH4Cl, the perovskite films prepared by one-step method present better morphology than films without adding NH4Cl, namely, smoother surface and better coverage which result in uniform and much more stable photoluminescence intensities as well as longer lifetime of photoexcitations. More importantly, the photovoltaic cells fabricated with the addition of the NH4Cl have far better performance than the cells without additives.

Optically uniform anatase TiO2 thin films are formed after annealing at temperatures \u2265500\u202f\u00b0C. The surface morphology shows porous structure with pore sizes of \u224515\u201330\u202fnm. The volume porosity of a mp-TiO2 thin film is estimated for the first time by using the Volume Average Theory with the experimentally measured effective refractive index of the film, and confirmed by a statistical and 3D interactive method for void volume determination in the cross sectional image of the same film. It is found that this volume porosity varies slightly, from 40.3% to 43.6%, when the spin speed is between 1000 and 2500\u202frpm. However, the volume porosity is significantly reduced to 33% for a very slow spin speed like 500\u202frpm. Using these mp-TiO2 thin films as electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells, it is confirmed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells is a function of both the mp-TiO2 layer thickness and volume porosity, giving the maximum PCE in a cell sample that combines a larger thickness and higher volume porosity.",

In this report, diethyl ether solvent engineering technique was used for Methyl ammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite thin films for planar heterojunction solar cells which exhibited a PCE of 9.20%. Morphological improvements and enhanced grain sizes leads to enhanced absorption of CH3NH3PbI3. Moreover solar cells have showed an excellent environmental stability of more than 100 days. This increase in efficiency is due to improved film morphology of perovskite layer after solvent treatment which has been revealed under UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy, SEM images, X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy.",

        "abstract": "In planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells (PerSCs) without mesoporous metal oxide skeleton, there is challenge of formation perovskite film with full coverage to the conductive substrate through solution-process the lead halide precursors. Selecting a lead source with more volatile byproducts is an effective approach to obtain much smoother films with smaller and fewer pinholes. Herein, we demonstrate efficient CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM PHJ PerSCs by using lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2) as lead precursor. The morphology of the perovskite thin films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively, and the crystalline quality of the perovskite films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was used to investigate the PL lifetime of the perovskite film. The perovskite film derived from Pb(Ac)2 shows enhanced surface coverage and improved photoluminescence lifetime in comparison with PbI2 sourced perovskite film. Averaged over 20 individual devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices derived from Pb(Ac)2 reaches 14.81%, much higher than PbI2 sourced devices by one-step (8.23%) or two-step (10.58%) spin-coating.",

The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) levels of PDTSTTz and PDTSTTz-4 exhibit a suitable band alignment with the valence band edge of the perovskite. Both of them lead to improved device performances compared with reference pero-SCs based on P3HT as HTL. To further balance the charge extraction and the diffusion length of charge carriers, pristine C60 was introduced at the cathode side of the pero-SCs, working together with TiO2 as ETL. With insertion of both the HTL and ETL, the performance of pero-SCs was greatly enhanced. The optimized devices exhibited impressive PCEs of 14.4% and 15.8% for devices based on PDTSTTz and PDTSTTz-4. The improved performance is attributed to better light harvest ability, decreased interface resistance and faster decay time due to the introduction of the interlayers.",

The PM spectroscopy also shows the formation of sub bandgap states after illumination which is responsible for the red shift of PL. The light induced modification of optical properties is reversible after keeping the film out of illumination for several hours at room temperature. We analyze the photoinduced modification to be two-steps processes: the temporary sub bandgap states were first photogenerated in perovskite film, if those states interacting with more coming photons within their lifetimes, light induced metastable states responsible for red-shift of PL will be formed. This instability reduces the electronic bandgap and generates more traps which will degrade the performance of the related photovoltaic devices.",

This is indicative of rather different charge transport properties in the vacuum deposited MAPbI3 perovskites compared to those prepared from solution. On the other hand, we investigated the use of ionic interlayers as a possible alternative to low work function electrodes, whose reactivity towards air and moisture compromises the device stability. Two different electron extraction materials were evaluated as interlayers between the fullerene electron transport layer and a silver electrode, in particular a perylenediimide derivative and a conjugated polyelectrolyte. By studying the photovoltaic response and the electroluminescence properties of planar diodes using the ionic films and comparing them with devices employing barium, we found that such ionic interlayers can successfully replace the use of reactive electrodes, since they facilitate the electron extraction while reducing the non-radiative recombination at the electron transport interface.",

On the other hand, the two-step solution processed perovskite layers without the CH3NH3PbCl3 interlayer exhibit smaller and more cross-hatching grain structure and yield significantly smaller Jsc. Therefore our results revealed clearly that the insertion of CH3NH3PbCl3 interlayer, which affects the nucleation dynamics, may control the grain structure of the two-step solution processed perovskite layers and improve dramatically the photovoltaic performance of the resultant planar p-i-n type PSCs. Our CH3NH3PbCl3 interlayer may thus serve as an effective method for p-i-n PSCs to achieve high Jsc with thicker perovskite layer.",

So, the rGO/PEDOT:PSS composite was used as a hole transport layer (HTL) to fabricate perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As a result, PSCs with rGO/PEDOT:PSS as HTL exhibit improved power conversion efficiency than that of PSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL.

The photoluminance results demonstrated an improved electron extraction upon the MATS surface treatment.

Consequently, the conventional planar heterojunction solar cells based on the MALHs perovskite treated by MATS, showed an enhanced device efficiency of 16.10%.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that moisture with sunlight corrodes the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite into PbI2, which generates cracklike voids on the surface of illumination-degraded CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films. As a result, the PSC photovoltaic performance is degraded and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is reduced from 16.8 to 0.7%.

The performances of PSCs can be further adjusted by halide mixing of perovskite films. Preparing the MAPbX3-yIy films by low pressure vapor-assisted solution process (LP-VASP) could achieve pin-hole free perovskite films, which has the potential to mass production of perovskite films. In this study, the MAPbX3-yIy (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl, Br) thin films are prepared by exposing PbI2 films in various amine salts vapor and applied to fabricate the planar PSCs. Systematical structural-property investigations on the MAPbI3-yXy (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl, Br) thin films demonstrate that the halide-mixed perovskite films could be achieved by adopting different amine salts. The MAPbI3/MAPbCl3 biphasic constitution is observed in perovskite films using pure MACl, while the MAPbI3-yCly (y\u00a0\u2248\u00a00) could be obtained using MACl:MAI mixture. Using pure MABr or MABr:MAI mixture, the MAPbBr3-yIy films are prepared. The XRD and XPS results indicate that there is no remnant Cl in the MAPbI3-yCly (y\u00a0\u2248\u00a00) films, nor I in the MAPbBr3-yIy (y\u00a0\u2248\u00a00) films. Because the amine salts are excess, the halogen in amine salts mainly decide the halogen in CH3NH3PbX3 in our study. Moreover, the MAPbCl3-yIy (y\u00a0\u2248\u00a00) and MAPbBr3-yIy based PSCs are demonstrated to behave better stability than the MAPbI3 based PSC under continuous illumination at AM 1.5G.

Through experimental observations under simulated air-mass 1.5G illumination (irradiation intensity of 100\u00a0mWcm\u22122), the efficiency of a perovskite:PbS device is 11% higher than that of a pristine perovskite solar cell under the same fabrication conditions as a result of the broadened absorption range in the infrared region.

Interdiffusion protocol has been regarded as an efficient approach to deposit high-quality HIOP films. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of this protocol remains obscured. In this work, in virtue of vapor-deposited lead halide frame to eliminate solution-driven lead halide effect, we thoroughly studied the evolution of different HIOP films by symmetrically controlling the initial lead halides as well as organic salts. The crystal growth mechanism of the interdiffusion can be drawn in two aspects: 1. CH3NH3 (MA)-HIOP shows higher nucleation rate than (NH2)2CH (FA)-HIOP; 2. FA-HIOP and PbCl2-HIOP exhibit greater coarsening rates than other colleagues. Most importantly, conflicting lattice with Cl-barren phase and Cl-rich phase is first uncovered for MA-HIOP and FA-HIOP using PbCl2 frame. All the device performances based on these films also prove the potential mechanism, and champion efficiency of 16.01% is achieved based on FAPbI3.

Finally, we completed the perovskite solar cell device. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cell was 10.74%; the open circuit voltage (Voc) was 0.89\u202fV; the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) was 21.30\u202fmA/cm2, and the fill factor (FF) was 0.57.",

        "abstract": "In this work, fullerene derivatives (ICBA and PCBM) are dissolved into perovskite precursors, and the corresponding perovskite solar cells are fabricated. Compared to PCBM, ICBA has better solubility in perovskite precursor solution (DMF). The added small amount of ICBA filled the vacancies at the grain boundaries of perovskite, and produced continuous pathways for electron extraction to enhance performance. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, together with the impedance measurements confirm the enhanced electron transporting property in perovskite-ICBA film. An excellent PCE of 18.14% is achieved in CH3NH3PbI3-xClx-ICBA-based solar cells with significantly suppressed hysteresis. Poor solubility of PCBM leads to a low concentration of PCBM in perovskite precursor, and results in a moderate PCE of 16.54% in device containing Perovskite-PCBM. By contrast, device based on pristine perovskite shows an inferior efficiency of 15.49% with large hysteresis. PSCs prepared from perovskite-ICBA with large area (1.12\u202fcm2) are also fabricated, exhibiting a PCE of 13.69%. Results demonstrate that the strategy of dissolving ICBA into perovskite precursor directly is an efficient and facile way to improve PSCs performance as well as to reduce hysteresis.",

Solution-process methods for the perovskite film appropriate under ambient conditions are desired to be explored for the practical industrialization. Here, a secondary crystal growth strategy is developed for the fabrication of perovskite film in ambient atmosphere. By this method, the conversion from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 on the planar substrate can be completed, overcoming the limitation of standard sequential deposition. After secondary growth, high-quality crystals are obtained and compact densely to form a pinhole-free film. Exceeding 17% of power conversion efficiency is achieved for planar CH3NH3PbI3 devices by controlling the reaction time of two stages carefully. This method can be easily controlled, reproduced and performed in the ambient, which meets the industrial requirements for highly efficient, low cost planar perovskite solar cells.",

After being stored at ambient air for 104 days (relative humidity between 50% and 70%), 94.19% of the starting efficiency was preserved for devices without any encapsulation. Moreover, effect of thickness of SiO2 blocking layer on device performance was studied by tuning the concentration of SiO2 paste. A moderate concentrate was found to be beneficial to device performance. Without blocking layer, poor performance was observed due to short cutting between top electrode and bottom electron-transport-layer; when concentration of SiO2 paste is relative higher (which corresponded to relatively thicker films), cracks appeared which caused short-cutting. Finally, due to the relative higher preservation of Si element (more than 1000 times of Zr) in earth, applying SiO2 as blocking layer could further lower down the cost of the carbon based hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.",

The first layer was constructed by hydrothermal derived SnO2 nanoparticles, and the second layer was in-situ formed from hydrolysis and oxidization of SnCl2. It was observed that the two-step formed SnO2 layers could efficiently improve the device performance of the flexible perovskite solar cells. Without such layers, no photovoltaic effect was observed due to poor wettability of substrate. After SnO2 was deposited, power conversion begins due to improved crystallinity of perovskite layer. Compared with one-step processed SnO2 layer, the two-step processed SnO2 layers could take the advantages of accelerated charge extraction, lowered contact resistance, as well as reduced charge recombination, which help to upgrade open circuit voltage, short circuit current, fill factor and power conversion efficiency of the flexible devices. Device efficiency of 15.21% (AM 1.5\u202fG, 100\u202fmW/cm2) was obtained for the flexible devices, with prolonged shelf-stability in addition. After being stored in dark for 111 days (relative humidity of 35\u201355%, no encapsulation was used), device could keep 85% of starting efficiency. Meanwhile, specific power (ratio between power and device weight) of 0.87\u202fkW/kg was obtained, as well as sound fatigue ability against bending.

        "abstract": "Organometal halide perovskite solar cell enjoys a rapid development in the last decade. However, the severe J-V hysteresis existed in perovskite solar cells leads to an over- or under-estimation of device efficiency. Herein, we introduce an ammonium salt as a new dopant of perovskite. As a result, the J-V hysteresis is almost eliminated, and a higher average efficiency is obtained. Besides, the degradation under constant illumination in ambient atmosphere observed in control devices is greatly improved. Thin film characterizations reveal that the addition of ammonium salt leads to smoother, more homogenous and better crystalline perovskite films, which exhibit more intense photoluminescence and a little longer fluorescent lifetime. Such improvements are owing to the dual-functional sulfoxide (SO) in the dopant that can assist in perovskite crystallization and passivate the surface defects, thus giving rise to the eliminated J-V hysteresis. Our results provide an easy way to eliminate the J-V hysteresis in perovskite solar cell.",

An efficient TiO2 blocking layers (BL-TiO2) was prepared by spin-coating the precursor solutions containing ethanol (CH3CH2OH), titanium n-butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4) and diethanolamine (C4H11NO2 DEA) with different molar ratios (CH3CH2OH: Ti(OC4H9)4: DEA\u202f=\u202f30: 1: x) on TiCl4 per-treated FTO glass.

        "abstract": "The stability of perovskite solar cells exposed to prolonged solar irradiation is a major concern that has not been thoroughly investigated in the past. In this investigation, devices fabricated with the architecture, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag using Pb acetate as a source material, were found to operate with an efficiency of about 13%. Adding excess amounts of Pb to the precursor resulted in a presence of Pb in the perovskite (PVS) active layer. In addition, the impact of photo-induced degradation on the device efficiency was investigated. X-ray Diffraction and Time-resolved Photoluminescence analyses were used to evaluate the impact of excess Pb before and after illumination. The results indicate that changes in the crystallinity occur without any significant decrease in charge carrier lifetimes, and this is attributed to the formation of the degradation product, PbI2. This by-product has been shown to have beneficial effects due to its influence in passivating grain boundaries and in altering the band structure at the interface between the active layer and the electron transport layer. This work demonstrates that 5\u202fmol% excess Pb is the optimal concentration with respect to efficiency and stability of these devices. The devices can retain more than 50% of their initial efficiency after 1\u202fh of simulated solar exposure, when compared to 0\u202fmol% and 10\u202fmol% excess Pb samples.",

Photo-catalysis effect is a highly concerned issue for such TiO2 based devices because of its impact on device stability. To deal with the problem, a strategy was proposed to passivate the surface of TiO2 by a thin layer of in-situ formed SnO2, and then perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were prepared using such modified TiO2. It was observed that, after the surface passivation, photo-to-electric power conversion efficiency, hysteresis as well as stability of the TiO2 based PSCs were all improved. For example, efficiency increased from 14.92 (\u00b11.86)% (AM 1.5G, 100\u202fmW/cm2) to 16.33 (\u00b10.26)%; hysteresis index decreased from 20.49 (\u00b111.85)% to 1.40 (\u00b10.01)%. As for stability, after being stored for 25 days (relative humidity of about 45%, no encapsulation), efficiency could preserve 73.99% of the original value, comparing to 47.55% for device based on bare TiO2. Moreover, the passivation was found to accelerate electron extraction, while retard charge recombination between perovskite and TiO2. The improvement was ascribed to the enhanced contact between perovskite and bottom electron-transport-material, passivated surface defects of TiO2 by SnO2, as well as the high mobility of SnO2. Finally, designated ultraviolet (UV) illumination experiment showed that SnO2 passivation could obviously retard the photo-catalysis activity of TiO2, thus improve the UV stability of the devices.",

Here, a facile way to deposit c- TiO2 film is performed by doping the pristine titanium isopropoxide precursor with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a distinct enhancement in the PeSC performance is observed. The PeSC based on 10% TiCl4 doped precursor achieves an efficiency up to 20%, presenting almost 43% enhancement compared to the pristine c-TiO2 based counterparts. The morphological and structural analyses clarify that the doped precursor not only forms the condense TiO2 film, but also conformally covers on the FTO substrate. Steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy and electrical impedance spectroscopy were conducted to study interface engineering and charge carrier dynamics, which correlates the different behavior of the c- TiO2 layers to the photovoltaic performance. Our results suggest that conformal coverage of c-TiO2 is more beneficial for electron transfer and transport between perovskite and FTO, which significantly alleviates charge recombination and then improves the device performance.",

Finally, optimized power conversion efficiency is achieved at moderate concentration or 0.6\u202fmol/L, which is 12.59 (\u00b10.40) %, compared to 11.81 (\u00b10.36) % at 1.0\u202fmol/L. Due to the barrier provided by the carbon film against H2O/O2, all of the devices showed good shelf-stability, though loading of perovskite is varied in these devices.",

These perovskite solar cells have advantages of low-cost and are easy to scale up, however the micrometer-thick mesoscopic layers and one-step dropping method challenge perovskite crystallization in such devices, resulting in non-ignorable charge-recombination loss. With adding an optimized 0.25\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121 PCBM into the perovskite precursor solution, we improve the champion PCE of PSCs using MAPbI3 perovskites from 8.58% to 12.36% and that of PSCs using MAPbI2.95(BF4)0.05 perovskites from 12.77% to 14.26%. We find that the PCBM additive affects the perovskite morphology, facilitates the photo-generated charge separation and suppresses the charge recombination in the device, thus yielding a universal improvement of MPSC performance.

Employing a 55-nm thick 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthienyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2\u2032,3\u2032-d\u2019]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b\u2019]dithiophene (ITIC-Th) as electron transport layer, an average PCE of 8.4% was achieved for the 2D PSCs, which was comparable to that of 2D PSCs based on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). However, the long-term stability of the 2D PSCs was improved as the degradation of PCE was reduced from 19.8 to 14.6% following a 15-day duration, which can be attributed to the strong hydrophobic property of the ITIC-Th. The best sample based on the 55-nm thick ITIC-Th exhibited a high PCE of 8.9% with a stable power output and negligible hysteresis, indicating the superior electron transport property of ITIC-Th. Our results demonstrate that ITIC-Th is an effective alternative to PCBM to fabricate highly efficient and stable 2D PSCs.",

To address this issue, several attempts are explored on film formation and interface engineering to improve efficiency. Here, adding alanine into pristine PEDOT:PSS proved beneficial to reconstruct the distribution of the -SO3- and -SO3H groups, resulting an improvement of the charge collection and transport owing to the weakened enrichment of -SO3H. The conductivities of reconstructed PEDOT:PSS films were improved as well as an enhancement of the hydrophobicity. A moderate concentration of alanine could effectively restrain the generation of \u03b4-phase perovskites film and enhance crystallinity of the CsxFA1-xPbI3.

It is observed that, with increment of the film thickness, perovskite crystallites become smaller; As for the performance parameters, open-circuit voltage (VOC) drops slowly; while short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) rise at first, and then decrease after the film thickness surpasses about 22\u202f\u03bcm. The slight decrease in open-circuit voltage (VOC) is due to heavier recombination brought by smaller crystallite size of perovskite. The upgraded short-circuit current density is due to accelerated charge-extracting rate across the interface between perovskite and mesoporous carbon, as revealed by the transient photocurrent (TPC) decay measurement. As for the improved fill factor, it is ascribed to the increased conductivity of the mesoporous carbon film. Besides, shelf-stability of the devices is tested. Stability up to 112 days (relative humidity of 40\u201370%, no encapsulation) are observed for these carbon based mesoporous perovskite solar cells, even though the mesoporous carbon is as thin as \u223c4\u202f\u03bcm.

Complete realizations of photo- and electrically induced surface polarization and recombination are critically important for extensively upgrading solar cell performance. We have explored such effects in a planar solar cell comprising ITO(glass)/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3-xClx/PC60BM/PEI/Ag with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.4%. A remarkable frequency-dependence of surface polarization was observed for the operating device under illumination (i.e. short-circuit current Jsc condition) and at steady state (i.e. open-circuit voltage Voc condition). A sign reversal of the capacitance (i.e. negative capacitance) associated with the surface polarization and recombination was detected at some specific steady states. Based on capacitance-voltage (C-V) spectroscopic measurements and theoretical fittings, they can be understood that, (i) a naturally formed surface depletion region due to energy mismatch can be fully suppressed at a very low fluence and moderate forward bias voltage; (ii) a surface capacitance (Cs) appears at lower ac-modulation frequencies only; (iii) remarkable trap-assist and band to band surface recombination may play the dominant roles for generating the negative capacitive effect in the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx based photovoltaic system.",

Therefore, interface engineering is crucial for achieving high performance planar PSCs. Here, we reported a simple and effective interface engineering method which employed phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) thin film or fullerene (C60) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or their combination to modify the titanium dioxide (TiO2)/perovskite interface to obtain high performance PSCs. A comparative study between the effects of different fullerene derivative modifications was taken and indicated that adding proper C60-SAM into the PC61BM solution could improve the interface contact, increase the charge extraction and collection efficiency more obviously compared to the pristine PC61BM treatment. By combining the modified two-step spin coating method, the best performance device based on C60-SAM modified TiO2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.8%, much higher than the control device without the interface treatment (12.9%) and also higher than the PC61BM modified device (16.1%) based on MA1-yFAyPbI3-xClx perovskite.

        "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress in device efficiency of the perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), the origin of commonly observed large variability of device performance from one-step to two-step approaches is still elusive. Herein, the processing windows of perovskite films prepared by one-step and two-step processes have been investigated. We find that both perovskite films prepared by one-step and two-step methods in air are much rougher than that prepared in glovebox. For the one-step method, complete perovskite conversion can be readily achieved both in air and in glovebox, but totally different in surface morphology. For the two-step method, residual PbI2 are remained in perovskite film, particularly with larger amount for the film prepared in air. Both rough surface and incomplete conversion hinder the realization of high quality perovskite film in air. The photovoltaic performances of the PVSCs prepared by one-step and two-step methods in glovebox are systematically compared. The generally observed lower photovoltaic performance of two-step PVSCs is ascribed to the additional trap-assisted recombination process due to larger trap density in the two-step perovskite film. This is confirmed by carrier recombination study using steady state photoluminescence, transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements. Finally, combining the high work function hole transporting material poly-TPD, and the high-quality one-step perovskite film, a 17.5% high-efficiency PVSCs can be achieved. The results reveal the major impacts on the morphological and electronic properties of perovskite films between one-step and two-step method, and it brings insight into the strategy for extending the processing windows to achieve highly reliable PVSCs.",

Aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) replaces the conventional FTO/TiO2(c)/TiO2(m) stack, considerably simplifying the fabrication process and reducing thermal budget. Photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that AZO is an effective ETL for perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) thin films, with a large valence band offset and a small conduction band offset, but with a possible path for carrier recombination at the interface. We show that treating the surface of AZO with ozone gas (AZO:O3) improves the charge carrier extraction at the interface. Detailed characterization of the AZO:O3/CH3NH3PbI3 interface shows that ozone reduces the oxygen vacancies and de-dopes top 6\u20139\u202fnm of the AZO surface.

The larger grains and better crystallized 2D/3D perovskite films with fewer defects and interfacial contact between TiOx layer and active layer are beneficial to eliminate the light soaking effect and enhances the light stability. Transient PL spectra reveal that the 2D layer can act as an interface modification layer to promote the photogenerated carrier dissociation and hole extraction. By applying MAPbI3 and 2D/3D perovskite film as light absorbers in PVSCs, we are able to enhance PCE from 14.37% to 18.30%.",

Here, we report a novel 2D perovskite (PyEA)2MAn-1PbnI3n+1 (n\u202f=\u202f1\u20139) based on methylammonium (MA) and a new spacing ammonium of 4-Pyridine-ethyl ammonium (PyEA) cations. Considering the absorption of perovskite films, we choose a high n value of 9 to establish a 2D perovskite system of (PyEA)2MA8Pb9I28 with a bandgap of 1.65\u202feV as the active layer. The morphology of (PyEA)2MA8Pb9I28 film is improved by using an additive of methylammonium thiocyanate (MASCN), which leads to a highly efficient inverted solar cells with a planar structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/(PyEA)2MA8Pb9I28/PC61BM/BCP/Ag. An optimized efficiency of 9.05% is achieved. By virtue of the stable 2D perovskites, the unencapsulated device retains 50% efficiency after 7 days restored in air with a humidity of 55\u202f\u00b1\u202f5%, indicating excellent stability against moisture and oxygen. The high efficiency and good stability are attributed to the improved intermolecular interaction among PyEA molecules via hydrogen bond, which enables the charge transport between inorganic slabs in 2D perovskite. This work provides a new strategy to construct 2D perovskite for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells via hydrogen bond.",

Incorporation of Cl (from either PbCl2 or CH3NH3Cl) in crystal growth of CH3NH3PbI3 is known as an effective method to acquire larger crystal grains and longer carrier diffusion length. It has been reported that an intermediate phase of CH3NH3PbCl3 was usually observed during crystallization, which should be critical to the quality of the resulting perovskite, however, how the intermediate phase influence the crystal growth was lack of comprehensive understanding. In this study, through varying the mixing ratio of the precursors PbI2:2CH3NH3I and PbCl2:3CH3NH3I, we were able to systematically tune the content and the converting time of CH3NH3PbCl3. We found that suppressing the formation of CH3NH3PbCl3 within the as-cast films can effectively improve the quality (crystallinity and morphology) of the resulting perovskite films. The improvement led to significant enhancement of the performance of the corresponding p-i-n planar Pero-SCs. Under optimized conditions, the best PCE was increased from 12.8% to 16.2%, which should be attributed to the alleviated charge recombination due to the improved quality of perovskite films by suppressing the formation of CH3NH3PbCl3.",

The addition of AgInS2 into TiO2 induced a reduction of pinholes at the interspace of the grains of the TiO2. The PL intensity of the perovskite film deposited on TiO2/TiO2:AgInS2 QDs was quenched by the addition of AgInS2 QDs into TiO2. A rectification ratio (RR) of the planar PSCs was improved by using TiO2/TiO2:AgInS2 QDs as dual electron transport layers. As a result, fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with TiO2/TiO2:AgInS2 QDs (1.6\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121) increased up to 0.77 and 17.5% as compared with FF (0.73) and PCE (16.3%) of the device with TiO2 single layer.

This result is probably caused by the enhancement of light harvesting by AgInS2 QDs and the enhancement of the charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the dual electron transport layers. The long-term stability of the PSC with the dual electron transport layers was confirmed when 1.6\u202fmg\u202fmL\u22121 of AgInS2 was added, followed by the encapsulation and improvement of the retained PCE (after storing the device in air for 15 days), from 11% to 34%, as observed.

The antisolvent assisted crystallization (ASAC) has been proved to be an effective tactic to prepare compact and uniform polycrystalline perovskite film. However, most of the antisolvents currently used are highly toxic, and the perovskite crystallization process is difficult to control using pure antisolvent. Here, a green strategy is developed to improve the nucleation kinetics of perovskite precursor and the perovskite crystallization process. A mixed green antisolvent of ethyl acetate (EA)/petroleum ether (PE) is employed to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and replace traditional chlorobenzene (CB) and pure EA. With optimized proportion of EA and PE, the supersaturation degree is controlled via reducing the solvent evaporation rate and the nucleation rate, and it is good for crystal growth. Moreover, the grain growth rate and grain size are easily regulated, which contribute to the uniform, large grain and non-pinhole perovskite film. Correspondingly, the intrinsic perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 17.19% and an average efficiency of 16.25% (std 0.43).",

In this study, a facile and effective approach was developed to improve perovskite conversion rate and film quality via in situ solvent assisted crystallization (ISAC) and compositional adjustment.

Lithium-doped spiro-OMeTAD is one of the most commonly used hole transporting material, however, the hygroscopicity of lithium dopant usually causes serious moisture instability of devices. Herein, we demonstrate a dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as hole transporting layer to improve the ambient stability of planar perovskite solar cells. With the optimization of the thickness of spiro-OMeTAD layer, the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD based device achieved a comparable device performance with a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.92%. Moreover, the unencapsulated dopant-free device showed significantly improved stability, which still maintained 95% of its initial efficiency after storage in ambient environment for 60 days. This work provides a simple and valid approach to overcome the instability issue of spiro-OMeTAD based devices, paving a way to manufacture more stable and efficient perovskite photovoltaics.",

The introduction of PbCl2 between SnO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 layers boosted the crystallization of perovskite film, which promoted the photovoltaic properties of corresponding PSCs. The open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of the PbCl2-modified devices (1\u202fmg/mL) were 1.11\u202fV and 0.79, respectively, which were both higher than those of the reference devices without PbCl2 (1.04\u202fV and 0.76).

To regulate this crystallization process and to achieve it multiple times remains a humongous challenge.

In this work, a Lewis acid-base adduct approach in concurrence with hot casting technique was employed to efficiently control the perovskite crystallization by judiciously adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a precursor solution of lead iodide (PbI2) and methyl ammonium chloride (MACl) in dimethylformamide (DMF). High quality perovskite films were fabricated by precisely controlling the volume of DMSO which resulted in low recombination rate and which had better light harvesting ability. Uniform films of MAPbClxI3-x having large grain size were formed reproducibly on addition of 1.5 equivalents (eq.) DMSO to the precursor solution. Perovskite solar cells fabricated using this solution resulted in maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.11% with enhanced stability as compared to the reduced PCE values obtained with other DMSO ratios and pure DMF solution cast films.",

Finally, the inverted device with the CDs CIL exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.34% with the steady-state output PCE reaching 16.96%. The stability of devices was also enhanced due to the hydrophobicity of the CDs cathode interlayer.

The average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the freshly prepared PSCs was ~15.98%. With the aging, the hysteresis in the I\u2013V characteristics was increased and a noticeable rise in the deep traps has been noted. IS spectra demonstrates that charge transfer resistance of the samples was reduced with the passage of time, which indicates that the compact-TiO2 layer (blocking layer) might be degraded and the electrical properties of the FTO/TiO2/perovskite interfaces have been effected. Furthermore, the recombination resistance of the samples has also been decreased significantly during the aging process.

The GO and modified GOs (mGOs) with dihexylamine (DHA) and 2-ethylhexylamine (2EHA) as amine sources were used respectively as buffer layers in mixed halide mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in order to examine whether they could improve their performance. GO and mGO samples were characterized by several techniques such as X\u2013Ray Diffraction, X\u2013Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman analysis and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The preparation of the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite solution was performed using standard Schlenk techniques under argon atmosphere to attain a homogeneous coverage of the perovskite film. The solar cells with the additional layer of mGO derivatives between perovskite and hole transporting layer showed an improved overall performance compared to the reference devices which was attributed to the enhanced charge carrier transport via the mGOs. In particular, 10% increase to the overall performance of the solar cells was monitored in devices where 2-ethylhexylamine (2EHA) modified GO was used, compared to standard cell without buffer layer.",

The Mott-Schottky analysis reveals that the elevated open-circuit voltage (Voc) is attributed to the upshifting of flat band potential of TiO2 from \u22124.15eV to \u22124.02eV (vs. vacuum) after doping. Notably, the as-made cell shows low hysteresis and elevated stability with only 15% degradation of PCE (35% for PSC with pyrolyzed TiO2) after 550h/14 RH% ageing without encapsulation.",

The present study aims at silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) plasmonic effects on the photovoltaic characteristics of mesoporous hetrojunction perovskite solar cells. Ag NPs were embedded into a compact TiO2 layer, which commonly acts as hole-blocking layer in mesoporous perovskite solar cells. An optimum concentration of Ag NPs loaded on compact TiO2:Ag-NPs films of hole-transport material-free (HTM-free(perovskite solar cells leads to more than 30% enhancement in power conversion efficiency of the fabricated cells compared with what Ag nanoparticle-free samples can do. The improved performance can be attributed to the scattering effect from the incorporated Ag-NPs, which effectively extends the optical pathway of incident light that increases the photon absorption of the photoactive perovskite layer. In addition to the modulated optical properties of HTM-free perovskite solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that electron transport time at the interfacial layer of TiO2 and the photovoltaic perovskite layer decreases as a result of frequency response improvement in the photoanode interface.",

However, in this method complete conversion of Lead iodide (PbI2) into CH3NH3PbI3 is limited by the diffusion of CH3NH3I into PbI2 film, thus limits current density. Here, we report a facile method for enhancing perovskite film morphology by introducing a small amount of ammonium iodide (NH4I) as a halogen additive into PbI2 solution, which can react with PbI2 and forms nanostructured platelet structure that helps to diffusion of CH3NH3I, for further improving CH3NH3PbI3 film morphology. Under the optimized NH4I additive concentration of 5\u202fwt%, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 17.4% achieved, which is an improvement of 14% compared to that of the original device without the additive. SEM studies reveal that addition of NH4I into PbI2 films improves the porosity of the films, which helps to improve the perovskite film morphology by increasing the grain size. The enhancement of CH3NH3PbI3 film morphology is useful for increasing the optical absorption of perovskite film thereby increasing short-circuit current density, whence an improvement in the efficiency of the perovskite solar cell devices.

To date, diameter engineering without changing length is still a big challenge, which is another key factor on the performance of TiO2 NAs-based PSCs. Here, the diameter of TiO2 NAs was effectively engineered by annealing temperatures from 100\u202f\u00b0C to 500\u202f\u00b0C to enhance the crystallinity and surface smoothness of TiOx seed-layers, which restrained the transverse direction to decrease the average diameter of TiO2 NAs from 74 to 31\u202fnm via the Steric effect. In addition, the smooth TiOx seed-layers improved the vertical orientation of the TiO2 NAs. The TiO2 NAs were further applied as photoanodes in carbon-based PSCs without hole conductor layers. The fine and vertical TiO2 NAs enhance the performance of PSCs, which mainly results from the improved charge transfer and excellent transmission. The carbon-based PSCs with 31\u202fnm TiO2 NAs achieved the best performance with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 10.15%, which is higher than 7.18% of that based on the common TiO2 nanoparticles.

However, the serious electron-hole recombination arising from large interfacial energy differences has markedly limited charge extraction for enhanced photovoltaic performances. Herein, we systematically study fast charge extraction at TiO2/CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/carbon interfaces by setting intermediate energy levels with carbon quantum dots and red phosphorus quantum dots, respectively. The interfacial radiative or trap-dominant recombination can be significantly suppressed owing to the boosted charge transfer ability as well as the passivation effect by incorporating the carbon quantum dots and red phosphorus quantum dots into solar cells. Finally, the optimal perovskite solar cell device achieves a maximized power conversion efficiency of 8.20% under one sun illumination in comparison with 6.37% for quantum dots-free solar cell. Moreover, the efficiency is reduced by only 3% upon persistent attack with 80% relative humidity over 1000\u202fh, suggesting a good environmental tolerance to boost the commercialization.",

TiO2 compact layer and the mesoporous layer were also replaced by TiO2 nanorod arrays. The fully-air processed perovskite solar cells were easy to fabricate and demonstrated an enhanced efficiency and stability. The introduction of CuSCN improves the current density and the fill factor of the solar cell, thus leads to 29% increase in conversion efficiency. Intensity modulated photovoltage (IMVS) shows that the solar cell with CuSCN has a longer electron life time. Current attenuation curve shows that the current of the solar cell with CuSCN rises quicker and higher than that of the solar cell without CuSCN. The steady-state photoluminescence tests shows that the introduction of CuSCN layer enhances the separation of electrons and holes, thus reducing the recombination of electrons and holes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that the solar cell with CuSCN has low transport resistance and high recombination resistance, thus leading to the slower electron recombination rates. In addition, study shows that the use of CuSCN and carbon displays high stability, and both kind of cells keep over 80% of the initial efficiency after 30\u202fdays without encapsulation. This method simplifies the perovskite solar cell fabrication process and opens a door toward the cheap, stable and printable solar cell.",

In this paper, the morphology, structure, optical and electrical properties of perovskite films treated by two different multi-step thermal annealing methods have been studied and compared. For the conventional multi-step (CMS) annealing method, the surface morphologies and optical properties of films are significantly influenced by the annealing temperature due to the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. When the modified multi-step (MMS) method is adopted, the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 can be effectively suppressed. The best device treated by MMS method at 180\u202f\u00b0C showed a short circuit current density of 20.85\u202fmA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 0.96\u202fV, a fill factor of 72.7%, and a PCE of 14.7%, which is a 23.5% enhancement in PCE relative to the maximum 11.9% treated by CMS method at 160\u202f\u00b0C.

Application of the developed AZO film as conducting substrate has successfully been tested by fabricating perovskite solar cells on flexible Corning\u00ae Willow\u00ae Glass substrate.

The PSC configuration used in this study consists of mesoscopic structure with CH3NH3PbI3 as the perovskite absorber. A PSC with optimized mol% of Al and Mg doped mesoporous TiO2 layers has been shown to achieve up to 22% higher efficiency than that of pure TiO2. While the Mg doping only enhances the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the Al doping effectively enhances the VOC, the short-circuit current density (JSC), and the fill factor (FF). The occupancy of the doped metals in the lattice is confirmed by XRD, EDX, and XPS. The Mg doping increases the band gap of TiO2 while the Al doping decreases it. The wide band gap in Mg doped TiO2 reduces the electron and hole recombination rate, thus increasing the JSC and VOC. By Al doping, deep trap sites in the TiO2 are eliminated, and this effectively reduces the recombination losses and in turn, increases the JSC. The enhanced electron-hole generation rate attributed to the decrease in the band gap of Al doped TiO2 also increases the JSC. In addition, there is an enhancement on the electron mobility by the presence of Al metal and this gives an increase in the FF.

        "abstract": "In CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the subtle pinholes and grain boundaries are hardly avoided in the formation of perovskite film. The defected film often leads to a reduced efficiency due to a larger amount of electron trap sites which induce carrier recombination leading to electron loss. In this work, ultrafine exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (E-g-C3N4) nanoparticles are successfully synthesized by H2SO4 intercalation and NH3 stripping. The E-g-C3N4 has a lot of NH or OH groups, which could coil into nanoparticles spontaneous from nanosheets by hydrogen bonds. As an application in PSCs, the E-g-C3N4, as doping materials between MAPbI3 and the hole transport materials (HTMs), could magically self-recognize CH3NH3PbI3 grain boundaries and locate on them. Electron-hole recombination is greatly reduced even after incorporating trace of E-g-C3N4 by decreasing the deep electron trap centers at grain boundaries. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8% is achieved for the MAPbI3 based PSCs, which is 35% higher than the reference cell. Thus, it is a universal and efficient method to weaken the influence of unavoidable defects existing in pinholes and grain boundaries, and develop the low-cost preparation for large-area PSCs in general conditions.",

The surface modification of TiO2 electron transport layers is an effective way to overcome the problem. Here, we report the successful fabrication of high efficiency and negligible hysteresis planar perovskite solar cells through modifying the TiO2 electron transport layers with p-type NiO nanocrystals. We find that the NiO nanocrystals form large numbers of NiO islands rather than homogeneous NiO films on the TiO2 electron transport layers. This special island-like morphology is propitious to maintain high light transmittance and induce large crystal grains and high crystallinity of perovskite layers. Furthermore, the device with NiO nanocrystals modification shows more effective electron extraction and lower charge accumulation than the pristine one. The champion device can achieve forward-scanned and reverse-scanned efficiencies of 19.22% and 19.42%, respectively. Hence, it is a novel guideline toward facile surface modification of TiO2 electron transport layers for efficient and hysteresis-free planar perovskite solar cells.",

Cu:NiOx nanoparticles have been synthesized by a facile chemical method, and processed into a paste for screen printing. Extensive X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) analysis elucidates the co-ordination of Cu in a NiOx matrix and indicates the presence of around 5.4% Cu in the sample. We fabricated a monolithic perovskite module on a 100\u202fcm2 glass substrate (active area of 70\u202fcm2) with a thin Cu:NiOx layer (80\u202fnm), where the champion device shows an appreciated power conversion efficiency of 12.1% under an AM 1.5G illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported efficiency for such a large area perovskite solar device. I-V scans show that the introduction of Cu:NiOx mesoporous scaffold increases the photocurrent, and yields fill factor (FF) values exceeding 57% due to the better interface and increased hole extraction efficiency. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) results reinforce the above results by showing the reduction in recombination resistance (Rrec) of the PSCs that incorporates Cu:NiOx interlayer.

A comparative study on charge transport properties and electron life time for all the three PSCs were carried out by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and found to be greater for carbon-based PSC. Steady-state photocurrent measurement under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G) were carried out for conventional and carbon-based PSC, and better stability and lower rate of degradation was observed for carbon-based PSC.",

Studies on the effects of RTP of the CH3NH3PbI3 films and the PbI2 precursor layers revealed an increase in the open-circuit voltage as well as the short curcuit current due to the improved crystallinity and the change in the preferential orientation of the perovskite growth leading to better charge transport. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The optical and electrical properties were also measured.The perovskite films formed exhibited tetragonal crystalline structure with uniform and compact morphology. The thin films were photoconductive and possessed a direct band gap of 1.5\u20131.6\u202feV. The XPS analysis showed the presence of the constituent elements and their chemical states.

        "abstract": "NiO is extensively studied as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells but syntheses of NiO precursor involves toxic chemicals and time-consuming processes. Moreover, the synthesized NiO contains surface defects acting as trapping sites at the NiO/perovskite interfaces, resulting in poor charge extraction, hysteresis and light soaking. In this manuscript, we developed a non-toxic methodology for NiO precursor solution by using a simple mixture of NiO powder and HCl in an air environment. In addition, a new hot-casting technique was developed to successfully fabricate densely-packed, less defective NiO films. Interestingly, the hot-casting temperature was found to significantly affect morphology, film coverage and surface defects of NiO films. When a hot-casting temperature was below 100\u202f\u00b0C, non-uniform NiO films were sparsely formed on the FTO surface and were characterized by defects in the form of hydroxyl groups and water on the surface. Such defective NiO films resulted in severe hysteresis and light soaking effect due to the trapped charges at the defective NiO/perovskite interface of perovskite solar cells. In contrast, when the hot-casting temperature was 120\u202f\u00b0C, the NiO film formed densely-packed morphologies, covering the FTO surface. Furthermore, this film exhibited an ordered chemistry with strong Ni-O octahedral bonding and facilitated charge extraction at NiO/perovskite interface, resulting in a negligible hysteresis and light soaking. Finally, this non-toxic and simple method of fabricating NiO film will assist further development of perovskite solar cells.",

Yet, this remains very challenging for solution processed perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), especially mesoscopic PVSCs, due to the complicated crystallization kinetics of hybrid semiconductor materials within dynamic spin-coating and post annealing. In this work, colloidal Ge nanoparticles (NPs) were added onto a mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) electron transporting layer (ETL) to regulate perovskite crystal growth. Systematic investigation and optimization disclose that incorporation of an appropriate ratio of Ge NPs onto the m-TiO2 ETL can simultaneously increase the size of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, decrease the number of the grain boundaries and promote the interfacial properties of perovskite/m-TiO2. The related mechanisms are clarified through detailed morphology and crystal structure analyses. The electron mobility of the perovskite absorber, determined using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, was increased by over 5 times when an optimized amount of Ge NPs were employed. Average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59% was achieved from 16 cells and the best PCE of 19.6% was attained via the addition of the optimized amount of Ge NPs. We study the fundamentals of optics and physics behind the PVSC device based on the high refractive index Ge NPs. This work offers an innovative scenario to enhance the performance of perovskite based optoelectronics by employing optically stable, chemically inert, low-cost and green semiconductor NPs.",

The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited in air at 35% humidity. An average 11% and 12% enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved for 1\u202fwt% CNDs doping in the PSCs with PEDOT:PSS and NiOx, respectively. This improvement is attributed to high electron density of CNDs resulting in a triple increase of the electrical conductivity of the PC61BM layer and passivation of the perovskite/PC61BM interface that is reflected by an increase of the open-circuit voltage. In line with this, parallel resistance and fill factor of the PSCs are also improved. Moreover, the energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed additional free-charge carriers in the PC61BM layer generated under illumination that were detected via the polaron states formation in the band gap with positive effect on the short-circuit current. All these factors contribute to the PCE improvement. Stability tests of the PSC with PEDOT:PSS under a continuous 24\u202fhour 1.5 AM illumination showed a five times smaller final PCE decrease for the 1\u202fwt% CNDs doping of the PC61BM layer comparing to the undoped counterpart. The passivation effect of CNDs, namely electron filling the traps formed by the photo-dimerization and photo-oxidation of PC61BM molecules, is responsible for this remarkable improvement of the short-term stability.",

        "abstract": "Planar junction perovskite solar cells without the mesoporous layer are compatible to roll-to-roll processing due to their simple and low-temperature device fabrication processing, but these perovskite films always suffer from more imperfect qualities including pin-hole formation and incomplete coverage, compared with the PSCs processed within a mesoporous scaffold. Although various approaches have been explored to obtain homogeneous, dense and highly crystalline films, there are always many defects at the film surface, acting as charge carrier trap/recombination centers. Lewis acids and Lewis base can effectively passivate negative and positive defects, respectively, but the reports on the passivation of both the positive and negative defects at one time are still quite few. Here, we introduce a facile approach to passivating both the positive and negative defects at the surface through the self-assembly of Lewis base 4,4\u2032-bipyridine from PCBM onto the perovskite layer via vertical phase separation. Besides, the residual bipyridine in the PCBM layer contributes to enhance its electron transport ability. As a result, the as-prepared inverted PSCs show improved device performance. To be noted, this strategy would be compatible to roll-to-roll processing, avoiding the fact that functional layers are always thickness-sensitive, which may restrict large-area high-speed roll-to-roll processing. Compared with the monodentate ligand 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, although the bidentate chelating ligand 2,2\u2032-bipyridine can passivate the trap states due to the strong interaction with the perovskite, the chelation of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine to Pb atom promotes the formation of the \u03b4-phase and thus results in poor device performance.",

Furthermore, to enhance the correspondingly low open-circuit voltage (Voc) caused by a high charge recombination, an insulating layer was developed by spin-coating Al2O3 on the surface of the electron transport material (ETM).

The electrical conductivity of Bis-amide-TTF-based film was 1.28\u00d710-5Scm-1, which was greater than that of spiro-OMeTAD doped with t-butylpyridine and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (8.37\u00d710-6Scm-1). Bis-amide-TTF was applied as a hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The Bis-amide-TTF film has a deeper HOMO level than that of spiro-OMeTAD, leading to an increased open-circuit voltage of the PSCs. The power conversion efficiency of 14.5% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.8\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.11\u202fV, and a fill factor (FF) of 66% was achieved for PSCs fabricated with the dopant-free Bis-amide-TTF-based HTM, which was comparable to that obtained with spiro-OMeTAD with the dopants (15.5%).",

        "abstract": "Organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells emerge as one of the most promising photovoltaic technology due to its high performances. Particularly, inverted perovskite device architecture, due to low temperature processing, have a great potential in commercialization. High-crystalline quality perovskite film and interfacial passivation are essential to yield high performance devices. In this work, we employ a simple strategy of using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as both the interfacial layer and the additive to prepare efficient PSCs. MoS2 as an additive in perovskite can form the CH3NH3PbI3:MoS2 heterostructure, resulting in the homogeneous perovskite film with larger crystal grains. In addition, MoS2 as the buffer layer (BL) between poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and perovskite can prevent the decomposition of perovskite film by avoiding the direct contact with the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS films. On tedious optimization, the champion device based on active layer of CH3NH3PbI3:MoS2 (10 v%) as well as employing MoS2 buffer layer shows a remarkable improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (from 15.29% to 18.31%) and a better stability, with 87% of the initial efficiency sustained after 20\u202fdays.

This is the first demonstration of successful use of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles as hole transporting layer (HTL) in standard PSCs with the triple cation perovskite material. The synthesis of nanoparticles was done using a facile chemical precipitation method without the use of surfactant. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by the various techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis). The co-ordination of Ni in Co3O4 matrix, as well as M+nO bond lengths, were confirmed by the XAS studies. The standard mesoporous PSCs were fabricated by spin-coating a thin layer of NiCo2O4 (120\u00a0nm), and fabricated PSCs show an esteemed power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >14% (under standard illumination conditions) and long-term stability (under ambient condition RH\u00a0=\u00a030\u201340%) as compared to the spiro-based PSCs.

The performance of PSCs was further analysed by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Photoluminescence (PL), Time-resolved Photoluminescence (TrPL) studies.

While humidity and oxygen seem not to affect the HEL deposition step, the perovskite layer is notoriously influenced by the RH and by the presence of oxygen during its deposition. Until 10% of RH, the performance of devices prepared with a triple-cation perovskite layer deposited under a nitrogen environment was mostly unaffected, whilst for devices deposited in air that limit is lower.

By regulating the flow and the drying process of the one-step perovskite solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) solvent, a complete high-quality perovskite film was formed, and the domain size considerably increased from about 50 \u00b5m to 100\u2013200 \u00b5m.

We report herein a new design of ETL by combining ALD TiO2 with low-temperature combustion-processed NiO. Although the underlying NiO layer has a p-type conductivity and is known as a hole transporting layer (HTL), the NiO/ALD TiO2 bilayer can serve as an ETL with fewer traps, larger conduction band minimum (CBM) offset with CsPbIBr2 film, along with the similar optical transmittance, in contrast with individual ALD TiO2 ETL. Consequently, the resulting optimized CsPbIBr2 PSC yields the superior efficiency of 9.71% and photovoltage of 1.272\u00a0V, both of which exceed those of the one based on individualALD TiO2 ETL and even so-gel TiO2 ETL.

Here, we prepared a tin-doped TiO2 (Sn/TiO2) EEL that presented two main polymorphs, anatase and rutile, and successfully fabricated a high-performance planar PSCs. Besides, the band alignment between EEL and perovskite active layer could be optimized by tuning the Sn doping concentration and the ratio of anatase and rutile phases. The intrinsic conductivity, interface morphology, band alignment, and charge carrier dynamic were characterized and the relationship to the photovoltaic performance was clarified. As the Sn ions being doped into TiO2 structure, EEL presented the mixed TiO2 rutile/anatase phase, directly narrowing the bandgap and promoting mobility. Furthermore, the adjustment of the band structure can facilitate electronic transitions. Finally, a promising planar PSC with Sn/TiO2 phase junction EEL achieved a champion PCE of 15.4%.",

        "abstract": "In this study, experimental photovoltaic performance and their numerical SCAPS-1D simulations are compared for methylammonium-free perovskite solar devices based on the formamidinium organic cation. Experimentally, it is established that the incorporation of small amounts of cesium (Cs+) and bromide (Br-) into HC(NH2)2PbI3(FAPI) stabilizes the optically active \u03b1-FAPbI3 black phase, and boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of associated devices from 4 to 15% under standard illumination. The effect of series and shunt resistances (Rseries & Rshunt) were theoretically evaluated and discussed by modeling the electrical characteristics of the cell as a function of active layer composition, using the SCAPS-1D software. Ideal devices built without these parasitic resistances do not match the experimental trends, although they reflect the influence of bandgap edge on the photocurrent generation. Feeding the experimental Rseries and Rshunt values to SCAPS allows us to interpret the main limitations to the device current-voltage characteristics. The instability of the pure FAPI phase is responsible for the drastic deterioration in Rseries and Rshunt, ultimately influencing the fill factor. Our data clearly confirm the beneficial effect of mixed cation and mixed halides on device operation.",

Measurements indicate that the device based on N-TiO2 with a nitrogen content of 0.25% exhibits higher PCE (17.83%) than the device based on un-doped TiO2 (17.04%). Results show that the lowest series resistance is obtained in the device based on 0.25% N-TiO2, leading to an increase in the fill factor (FF) parameter. Also, higher VOC of this device results from lower e-h recombination due to longer electron lifetime than the un-doped sample. In addition, a slight increase in JSC is related to the small decrease in the band gap of TiO2 with nitrogen doping. Enhanced FF, VOC, and JSC are the main reasons for the improved performance of the PVSC devices by using the optimal level of nitrogen in TiO2.",

We found that spin coating of spiro-MeOTAD in an oxygen atmosphere alone was not adequate to functionalize its hole-transport property completely, and our systematic experiments revealed that the device efficiency depends on the ambient atmospheric conditions during the drying process of spiro-MeOTAD. Complementary incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), light absorption and photoluminescence quenching measurements allowed us to attribute the atmosphere-dependent efficiency to the improved electronic characteristics of the solar cells. Furthermore, our Fourier transform infrared and electrical impedance measurements unambiguously detected modifications in the spiro-MeOTAD after the drying processes in different gas environments. Our findings demonstrate that proper oxidization and p-doping in functionalizing spiro-MeOTAD play a very critical role in determining device performance. These findings will facilitate the search for alternative hole-transporting materials in high-performance perovskite solar cells with long-term stability.",

Apart from the high PCE, the stability of perovskite solar cells is another important issue for them to be commercially viable. To investigate the impact of electrodes on the stability of the perovskite solar cells, cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Cathode, having different cathode contacts of Al, Ag and AgAl alloy, were fabricated. The cells with an AgAl alloy cathode reached a PCE of 11.76%, which is slightly higher than that (11.45%) of the structurally identical cells with Ag contact, much higher than that for the ones with Al electrode (7.95%). The stable open-circuit voltage (VOC) of cells having an AgAl contact was demonstrated, with almost no change in the VOC after 360h aging under a relative humidity of 10% in air. However, there is an obvious drop in the VOC of the structurally identical perovskite cells with Ag cathode, e.g., an 85% decrease from its initial VOC value for cells aged under the same condition. The enhancement in the PCE of cells with AgAl cathode is attributed to the formation of AlOX, which can improve built-in potential in the cell and allow an effective electron extraction at the PCBM/AgAl cathode interface. An interfacial AlOX interlayer could be formed at the interface between PCBM and AgAl contact during thermal evaporation and aging. The presence of the interfacial AlOX interlayer helps to prevent the diffusion of the Ag atoms into the active layer, to improve the adhesion of the metal contact on PCBM and also to avoid moisture encroachment.",

        "abstract": "Perovskite (PS) solar cells have emerged as a promising technology for low-cost and efficient photovoltaics. However, the main limiting factors are related to their low long-term stability. The loss of performance of these devices is commonly attributed to degradation of the PS itself. In order to further explore the origins of such limited stability, we have developed UV\u2013vis spectroscopy studies that clearly demonstrate that PS layers remain unalterable under the working conditions. On the contrary, significant variations in the absorption spectra of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer (Spiro), a commonly used hole transporting material (HTM), indicate that the loss of performance over the irradiation time are attributed to the degradation of Spiro. UV\u2013vis measurements evidence a photo-induced oxidation of Spiro, both under air and inert atmosphere. This photo-oxidation is accelerated by the commonly employed additives of the Spiro (LiTFSI and tBP), as well as by the interfacial contact with the electron injecting layer (TiO2). Therefore, our results point to the Spiro degradation as the main mechanism that induces the limited functioning of the PS solar cells. Consequently, focusing on the development of alternative HTMs stable under the working conditions is one of the critical issues to be overcome for a suitable progress of PS solar cells and related opto-electronic devices.",

While commercial FTO or ITO either requires high temperature and high vacuum process or contains rare indium element, which will increase the production cost of PVKSCs.

The UV\u2013vis optical transmission, crystal structure, sheet resistance, surface morphology, elemental composition and static contact angles measurement of the original and recycled FTO/glass substrates (one time and two times) were measured and compared. Planar ETL-free devices with power conversion efficiencies of about 10% have been achieved by adopting the recycled FTO/glass substrates, which are comparable to that of the devices based on the original FTO substrates, suggesting the feasibility of recycling the FTO/glass substrates from degraded devices for fabricating ETL-free PVKSCs.",

The use of CB promotes the formation of homogeneous films. Heat treatments at low temperature promote grain growth and agglomerations leading to decrease in surface roughness and the removal of chlorobenzene traces present in the film, which in turn leads to the improvement of the interface between the gold contact and perovskite layer.

PbBr2 was used to either replace or to be mixed with PbI2 to form pre-deposited films that were then reacted with CH3NH3I vapor. Detailed structural, spectroscopic, and morphological characterizations of the perovskite films unambiguously demonstrate the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 films. However, bromine incorporation slows down the perovskite formation process through formation of an intermediate phase, CH3NH3PbBrxIy, which improves the grain domains in the as-fabricated perovskite films. Enhancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the as-fabricated planar-heterojunction structured PSCs were found for samples in which bromine was incorporated. Meanwhile, transient photovoltage decay measurements revealed that carrier recombination was suppressed throughout the entire device.

After formulation of the precursor solution and optimization of the coating process, planar perovskite thin films containing large-size grains with low surface roughness were obtained. We found that anti-solvent plays an important role in determining the uniformity, size of grains and width of grain boundaries in perovskite films. The addition of 5vol% isopropanol into the precursor solution leads to the formation of large aspect ratio grains with a length ca. 200\u00b5m and width of a few hundred nanometers, together with narrow grain boundaries. However, the absence or excessive of isopropanol result in perovskite films with high surface roughness and broad grain boundaries due to inefficient crystal growth or the formation of ridges between crystal grains. These grain boundaries have high PL intensity due to charge recombination and consequently deteriorate device efficiency. When bar-coating the perovskite films in air, best devices with PCE over 11% can be achieved with a relatively high humidity around 50%, eliminating the low humidity requirement during air processing.",

Although being highly akin from a chemical and structural point of view, these films show substantial differences in their optoelectronic characteristics. For chloride-treated perovskite films we find an enhanced average power conversion efficiency of 10.3% and charge carrier mobility of \u03bc=2.16cm2/Vs in comparison to 5.3% and \u03bc=1.62cm2/Vs for untreated MAPI films, respectively. Moreover, we observe different light-soaking behavior and increased photoluminescence lifetimes of 70ns in the case of chloride-treated MAPI and 100ns for pure MAPI.

Solar cells fabricated using this methodology exhibited power conversion efficiencies over 16% with negligible photocurrent hysteresis.",

PbCl2 has been reported to enhance crystallinity but long annealing time is required. Pb(Ac)2\u00b73H2O is used because it is cheap and easy to get, and lead acetate offers fast crystallization process, meanwhile the trihydrate might improve the film stability. With an optimal blending ratio of the two precursors (1:1mol ratio), compact and full-coverage perovskite film with large grain sizes (>1\u00b5m) are obtained, and the speed of perovskite film formation is greatly accelerated. Moreover, the film prepared in a 1:1mol ratio of the two precursors exhibits good moisture liability for several days under around 70% RH environment. As a result, the PbCl2: Pb(Ac)2\u00b73H2O (1:1) results in the highest efficiency of 14.77%. The findings in this work provide a facile way to improve the perovskite film quality and stability.",

However, perovskite films often suffer from voids and roughness, inducing depressed photovoltaic performance, and this problem is even more severe for thinner perovskite films. Herein, a poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) additive is incorporated into CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solutions to control the crystal growth of a visible-light-semitransparent perovskite layer (thickness: ~150nm) in a one-step deposition process. The characterization results show that the coverage and smoothness of the perovskite films can be significantly improved, and the perovskite crystal boundaries are also reduced by introducing a moderate amount of PVDF-HFP. When the precursor solution containing 12mg/mL PVDF-HFP, the highest power conversion efficiencies of 10.6% and 8.8% (backward scan) is achieved for the photovoltaic devices with 80 and 20nm-thick Au electrode, respectively, which is over 30% higher than that of the PVDF-HFP-free control. Time-resolved photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterizations further demonstrate that the PVDF-HFP additive can improve the carrier lifetimes and reduce the charge transfer resistance, which contributes to the enhanced photovoltaic performance. Thus, we propose a strategy specific to a high-quality visible-light-semitransparent perovskite layer and for high-performance perovskite solar-cell preparation.",

For the first time, we report Al2O3 layer passivated TiO2 nanorods (NRs) array as an electron transfer layer (ETL) for thermal evaporation-route synthesized formamidine lead iodine (FAPbI3) PSCs. The modification of Al2O3 layer on TiO2 NRs can efficiently enhance charge transport and retard charge recombination at interface between ETL and FAPbI3 layers. PSCs based on evaporation-fabricated FAPbI3 absorption layer and Al2O3-TiO2 ETL display excellent photoelectronic performance, showing a high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 14% with negligible hysteresis and excellent reproducibility and stability. Al2O3 passivation can induce an obvious fluorescence quenching phenomenon and reduced electron-hole recombination rate. The greatly improved performances can be attributed to the following three factors. Firstly, Al2O3 buffer layer as a barrier can effectively retard electrons in ETL reversely transport and impede charge carrier recombination. Secondly, Al2O3 passivation can enhance the TiO2/FAPbI3 interface contacts, alleviate the electron trapping effect resulted from the surface defects at TiO2/perovskite interface, benefiting for electron extraction to be transported directly toward FTO.

Thus, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been widely used to enhance the solubility through the formation of adducts. However, the required mixture of DMSO and DMF cannot be simultaneously evaporated at low temperatures, owing to the different boiling points, which are influenced by the surface morphology. Consequently, this also affects the solar energy conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells. In this study, we develop a new approach for controlling the evaporation of DMF and DMSO by dip-coating ether on the top of the prepared thin film composed of PbI2, methylammonium iodide (MAI), DMF, and DMSO. Interestingly, it reveals that ether acted as an agent for simultaneous evaporation at similar temperatures, which then allows it to control surface morphology, and achieve dense perovskite. The fabricated inverted-perovskite PbI2 thin film solar cell shows that the efficiency reached up to 16.3% with high reproducibility.

Here, we present a novel strategy to reduce penetration of humidity and oxygen into perovskite films via incorporation of a diammonium glycol. The two ammonium groups of this molecule allow it to serve as a crosslinker in the structure, bridging two unit cells within a crystallite or even across a grain boundary. In a planar heterojunction solar cell containing PCBM as an electron transport layer, the power conversion efficiency of the cell with ~0.1% diammonium glycol in the absorber layer was 13.96%, slightly exceeding that of the glycol-free device (13.53%). Most importantly, the glycol-free device exhibited the typical growth in hysteresis with performance degradation, but hysteresis remained suppressed in the device doped with diammonium glycol, even as its overall performance deteriorated. Futhermore, the chemical stability of the unpackaged device under continuous AM1.5G illumination at ambient conditions was substantially improved relative to the glycol-free device. Formation of PbI2 was significantly suppressed, which could minimize release of toxic Pb ions.",

The annealing temperature of the CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx film is controlled to 105\u00b0C (slightly higher than the boiling point of water) to obtain the dense perovskite film rapidly in ambient environment with ~ 40% relative humidity.

The stable CH3NH3PbI3\u2212xClx\u00b7nH2O system can resist the decomposition of perovskite film and weaken iodide ion migration in PSCs, which enhance stability of the device under the atmospheric environment.

To solve the problems, interfacial engineering of electron collecting layer (ECL) compact-TiOx by a thin-layer of one-step solution-processed and low-cost organic material is applied. In contrast, commonly used PCBM is still expensive material. Herein, a new, low-temperature processable higher potential of [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives named as N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines (PNP) was introduced as an interfacial modification of ECL compact-TiOx with the varying thickness of 10, 20, and 30nm to replace the commonly used PCBM in PHJ perovskite solar cells. The modified surface morphology was achieved by introducing PNP interfacial layers that enhanced the surface-energy properties of the cells in terms of enhanced photocurrent. Compared with PCBM, PNP features a higher electronic mobility and stronger hydrophobic nature. The enhancement of power conversion efficiency was obtained from 5.12% to 8.23%, with an increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 11.90 to 21.44mAcm\u22122 and fill factor (FF) from 0.49 to 0.56 owing to insertion of optimum 10-nm-thickness PNP that led to more efficient electron transport and charge extraction in the solar cell performances.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is considerably lower than that of the standard PSCs using spiroOMeTAD as hole-conductor material and Au (or Ag) as counter electrodes. Herein, by means of incorporating p-type NiO nanoparticles into carbon electrodes, the PCE of the hole conductor-free PSCs was significantly boosted to 13.26% from 10.29% of that based on pure carbon electrode, because of the enhancement of hole transfer. In addition, the carbon-based hole conductor-free PSCs showed 85% of the initial efficiency after 800h in ambient atmosphere. The results indicate that the p-type NiO nanoparticles can enhance hole transfer from perovskite into carbon electrodes, and the carbon electrodes can prevent the water in the air to improve stability. While the PSCs using Spiro-OMeTAD as hole conductor and Ag as electrodes have slightly lower PCE of 13.24% and lower stability.

We evidence that while the electrical degradation takes place on a short time scale (2\u20133 days of exposure to ambient light conditions in a nitrogen atmosphere), no optical degradation is observed before 10 days when the dissociation reaction of methylammonium lead iodide starts acting. We find a very good agreement between XRD and ellipsometry measurements; both show the appearance of PbI2 after 1 week of exposure. We also confirm that the main mechanism at play is a light-induced degradation affecting the edges of the stack and the interfaces between the perovskite and the neighbouring layers.

Here, we report a simple ligand-exchange strategy to overcome the problems. We use oleic acid (OA) molecules as surface ligands for synthesis well crystalline and monodisperse TiO2 nanocrystals. Subsequently, instead of high temperature decomposition, we find that the ligand-exchange strategy can also totally peel off these insulating ligands on the TiO2 nanocrystal surfaces and form high-quality TiO2 ETLs at low temperature. The OA-free TiO2 ETLs prepared at 150\u00b0C show high conductivity, fast electron extraction and transport speeds, low series resistance and high shunt resistance in the assembled PSCs, contributing to high performance devices with slight hysteresis and good reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid halide perovskites materials have inspired enormous interest in the photovoltaic research community; however, they are currently plagued by insufficient environmental stability. To overcome this problem, all-inorganic halide perovskites have been developed and exhibit significantly improved stability. Here, vacuum thermal evaporation deposition of CsPbBr3 perovskite films is developed by dual-source coevaporation of CsBr and PbBr2 precursors. The evaporation rate ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 determines the stoichiometry of the deposited CsPbBr3 films, and the substrate temperature and post annealing temperature affect the crystallinity of the CsPbBr3 films. Through systematic optimization of the deposition parameters, high-quality CsPbBr3 films with good crystallinity and uniformity are obtained. Planar CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells with high efficiency of 6.95% in small size (0.09\u202fcm2) and 5.37% in large size (1\u202fcm2) are fabricated. Moreover, the CsPbBr3 solar cells show good long-term stability under ambient conditions without encapsulation.",

        "abstract": "The perovskite/c-Si tandem technology is considered as a cost-effective approach to realize a cell efficiency beyond the limit of single-junction (SJ) c-Si cells. Compared to its counterpart of 2-terminal (2T) configuration, 4-terminal (4T) tandem has the advantages such as no constraint of current matching and potentially simple mechanical stacking. But one of the largest challenges is the limited near-infrared (NIR) transmission of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cell (ST-PSC), which has been a bottleneck to the c-Si bottom cell performance and eventually the whole tandem cell performance. The highest NIR transmittance that has been reported is about 84%. In this contribution, we demonstrate a p-i-n planar ST-PSC with an efficiency as high as 15.7% and with a record NIR transmittance of about 92%. It is realized by optimization of the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) material properties and light management. This NIR-transparent and high-efficiency ST-PSC leads to a 4T tandem cell efficiency of 25.7%, using an interdigitated-back-contact (IBC) c-Si bottom cell.",

Except for TiO2, Nb2O5 has also been considered as ideal electron selective layer material for planar perovskite solar cell due to its excellent optical transmittance and similar Femi level with TiO2. Herein, we report niobium oxide film deposited by a simple and low temperature solution method, as an effective alternative to high temperature sintered TiO2 film in the regular architecture of PSC. Nb2O5 modification of FTO has successfully tuned the surface work function from 4.59\u202feV to 4.28\u202feV without obviously affecting the surface roughness and optical transmittance, which could significantly decrease energy level offset and improve the open voltage. Appropriate UV ozone treatment could adjust the surface hydrophilicity of Nb2O5 film benefiting the growth of perovskite films on low temperature solution deposited Nb2O5 coated FTO substrate. Relatively high efficiency over 17% with less J\u2013V hysteresis has been achieved by optimizing the precursor solution, spin rate, annealing temperature and UV ozone treatment time. The results indicate low temperature solution deposited Nb2O5 film can be a low cost and easy-prepared ETL material for high performance PSC.",

In this work, three solar cell technologies as candidates for building-integrated applications are compared regarding their normalized average efficiency as a function of light intensity and incident angle. The mechanisms that lead to higher efficiency independence are evidenced by comparing several cell designs for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) and perovskite solar cells (PSC). By doing so, it was found that superior efficiency independence towards tilted light is obtained for PSC with more transparent active layers due to optical path lengthening (OPL), while DSC were found to exhibit OPL in standard configuration. All cells show a fairly stable efficiency evolution when light intensity was reduced, while at lower light intensity PSC slightly outperform DSC. The almost constant relative efficiency evolution of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is a very interesting outcome of this work and so far, efficiency evolution of such SHJ under low light intensity have not been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge.",

The device based on B2T exhibited an optimal power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.0%, while that of B2F was 15.0% with a relatively low hysteresis. Compared to B2T device, the higher efficiency of B2F device was mainly due to the impressive increase in short-circuit current density (JSC), from 19.36\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 to 22.13\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122. By comprehensive analysis of the energy level and photoluminescence spectra of the devices, we inferred that the higher JSC was resulted from the lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of B2F than B2T, which induced a more efficient hole-blocking and less recombination of charge carriers. Through the molecular design (from thiophene to fluorene), we developed a highly efficient electron transporting material, this strategy may provide a new building block to develop novel efficient interface materials for PSCs.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown a highly efficient performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) of 22.7%. Although a number of efforts have been made to reproduce flat, uniform, and dense perovskite films using a stoichiometric ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO =\u202f1:1:1\u2032, several complicated processes are required to achieve a regular grain-to-grain uniformity. Therefore, it was difficult to reproduce. This is because the conventional ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO =\u202f1:1:1\u2032 can cause the CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase and the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal phase to coexist in solution. As a result, the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in the solution may deteriorate the quality of the thin film. In this study, the non-stoichiometric molar ratio among CH3NH3I:PbI2:DMSO solutions was applied to control the quality of the perovskite layers. We successfully fabricated uniform and dense CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs, by simply manipulating CH3NH3PbI3 solubility with the different DMSO molar amounts. Further, a homogeneous grain size and a regular inter-grain arrangement with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were obtained in the optimized solubility. We also confirmed that the PSCs with the optimized condition exhibited higher Jsc (Current density) and PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency), due to the Lamer model effect on the enhancement of the internal light absorption.Furthermore, the device with the optimized solubility exhibited enhanced electrical properties. Especially, the improved-electrical properties of the charge carrier-separation, mobility, collection, generation, and resistances were confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) quenching/mapping of the space-charge limited current (SCLC), the photo current density as a function of internal voltage (Jph\u2013Vint) characteristic, and the impedance. Consequently, it was shown that tailoring the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 can have a critical effect on the production of high quality perovskite thin films.

In this kind of PSCs, perovskite precursor solutions are dropped on the three layer mesoscopic scaffolds, so it is important to improve the crystallinity as well as the penetrability into the mesoscopic scaffolds. Thiourea that has two NH2 groups and one S-donor can form hydrogen bond with the perovskite crystals or lewis acid-base adducts to retard the growth of perovskite crystals. In this work, it is found that thiourea facilitate the penetrability of perovskite precursor solution into the mesoscopic scaffolds and the crystallinity of perovskite crystals. It is suggested that such effects are associated with the cross-liker function and with the retarding function of thiourea. With adding thiourea into the perovskite precursor solution, electron transfer from perovskite crystals to FTO and the recombination resistance are enhanced, so that the performance of thiourea based device was improved from 10.20% (the pristine device) to 13.03%.

    "Open atmospheric processed perovskite solar cells using dopant-free, highly hydrophobic hole-transporting materials: Influence of thiophene and selenophene \u03c0-spacers on charge transport and recombination properties": {
        "abstract": "We have synthesized three donor-\u03c0-acceptor polymers by crosslinking 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b'] and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione with thiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, selenophene as \u03c0-spacer. These polymers have been integrated successfully as dopant-free hole-transporting materials in fully open atmosphere solution-processed lead halide perovskite solar cells. Due to the synergistic impact of linear and long alkyl chains with different \u03c0-spacers, these hole transporters retard interfacial charge recombination and afford rich solubility and morphology resulting long carrier lifetime with uniform film coverage. In addition, these hole transporters possess a deeper highest occupied molecular orbitals (\u22125.40, \u22125.37 and \u22125.42\u202feV) and suitable over potential with perovskite valence band (\u22125.43\u202feV), favorable for efficient hole extraction. Further, the large number of S-based heterocycles helps to strengthen the interaction of the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface and high hydrophobicity (\u223c104\u00b0) facilitate enhanced stability with insignificant hysteresis. As a result, the power conversion efficiency has reached 14% under AM1.5\u202fG without any additives in fully open atmospheric conditions. Our findings highlight the better energy transfer capabilities of additive-free hole transporters as a promising candidate for developing stable PSCs in the open air.",

However, due to the hygroscopic nature of halide perovskite materials, moisture significantly affects the stability, lifetime and performance of the device. In this work, we combine thiocyanate-doped pseudohalide perovskite with additive solvents to achieve compact films showing high-quality crystal grains with improved longevity of the perovskite films using a simple two-step spin-coating method under ambient conditions. Indeed, we confirm that humidity has a profound impact on the crystal quality. Perovskite films with grain sizes as large as 4\u202f\u03bcm are produced in high humidity conditions, using methylammonium iodide precursor solution mixed with deionized water and ethanol. Power conversion efficiencies up-to 9.4% have been achieved for optimized planar device architectures fabricated above 60% relative humidity. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and current-voltage characteristics for devices stored in ambient conditions for more than 480\u202fh show that the films are quite stable with only a 12% decay of their initial power conversion efficiency.",

Among the two widely used perovskite solar cell device architectures of n-i-p and p-i-n, the latter is interesting in terms of its simplicity of fabrication and lower energy input. However this structure mostly uses PEDOT:PSS as a hole transporting layer which can accelerate the perovskite solar cell degradation. Hence the development of stable, inorganic hole extraction layers (HEL), without compromising the simplicity of device fabrication is crucial in this fast-growing photovoltaic field. Here we demonstrate a low temperature (~100\u202f\u00b0C) solution - processed and ultrathin (~6\u202fnm) NiO nanoparticle thin films as an efficient HEL for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. We measure a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% on rigid glass substrates and 8.5% on flexible substrates. A comparison with PEDOT:PSS based MAPbI3 solar cells (PCE\u202f~\u202f7.9%) shows that NiO based solar cells have higher short circuit current density and improved open circuit voltage (1.03\u202fV). Apart from the photovoltaic performance under 1 Sun, the efficient hole extraction property of NiO is demonstrated for indoor lighting as well with a PCE of 23.0% for NiO based CH3NH3PbI2.9Cl0.1p-i-n solar cells under compact fluorescent lighting. Compared to the perovskite solar cells fabricated on PEDOT:PSS HEL, better shelf-life stability is observed for perovskite solar cells fabricated on NiO HEL.

        "abstract": "For future mass production, it is the best choice to fabricate highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the ambient air. Interface modification is widely reported as an effective method for boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In our manuscript, CsBr as the interface modification material was introduced into the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) via two ways: doping into the mp-TiO2 layer and inserting between the mp-TiO2 and perovskite films. It was found that CsBr interface modification, especially by doping into the mp-TiO2 layer, can passivate the trap states originated from VO in mp-TiO2 leading to enhanced carrier transport properties, meliorate surface property of mp-TiO2 resulting in high-quality perovskite films, improve the carrier extraction and decrease the trap recombination in the interface. High-quality perovskite films, with increased grain size, reduced grain boundaries and pinholes, were obtained after CsBr modification, and further applied for the PSCs. The whole preparation process of the PSCs was finished in ambient air. The champion device with CsBr doped into the mp-TiO2 layer yielded a highest PCE of 17.33%, while the pristine device showed a PCE of 14.95%. Furthermore, the champion PSC with CsBr doped into the mp-TiO2 layer exhibited a much better stability, which could maintain over 80% of the original PCE after 1000h storing in ambient air without any encapsulation. This work presents an approach to develop air-processed efficient and stable PSCs by interface modification for future mass production.",

        "abstract": "Perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a very promising solar photovoltaic technology with fivefold increase observed in the device efficiency within less than 10 years of its inception. The efficiency of these solar cells is strongly affected by the quality of perovskite layer surface coverage and its grain size. Although use of antisolvents such as chlorobenzene has been used to treat methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) resulting in grain size of ca. 200\u2013300\u202fnm, one still needs to minimize the grain boundaries to reduce their impact on recombination. In this study, we have successfully incorporated [6, 6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) acceptor as an additive in the perovskite layer of the mesoscopic solar cell devices, which not only leads to the formation of larger grains with fewer grain boundaries resulting in reduced charge carriers recombination, the band alignment between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 was also found to improve. The device having the optimum PC70BM concentration in perovskite showed enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to improvement in current density (JSC) and fill-factor (FF), correlated to the decrease in charge transfer resistance (RCT). The devices using PC70BM additive exhibit over 15% improvement in the power conversion efficiency or PCE (15.5% for PC70BM containing device and 13.3% PCE for the reference device with no acceptor additive). More importantly, the device containing PC70BM acceptor additive, retained ca. 75% of the original PCE for 250\u202fh when kept at 85\u202f\u00b0C without encapsulation in an ambient at 20% RH.",

        "abstract": "Solvent engineering has been considered a reliable process for the fabrication of pinhole-free and highly crystalline perovskite thin films. Recently, green solvents have received immense attention, as the toxic antisolvents used in the conventional fabrication process cause environmental and health hazards. In this regard, ethyl acetate (EA) is a promising environmentally friendly antisolvent. Here, we present the fabrication of perovskites with controlled morphologies by changing the composition of the perovskite and the volume of EA in ambient humidity. The incorporation of [HC(NH2)2]PbIBr2 into a CH3NH3PbI3 matrix results in a grain size up to ~1.5\u202f\u03bcm. This induces a considerable reduction of trap density, leading to the suppression of charge recombination and, consequently, improvement in the photoluminescence characteristics. The resulting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the optimized devices are 20.93% and 19.51% for active areas of 0.12\u202fcm2 and 0.7\u202fcm2, respectively. The reduced diffusion of moisture along grain boundaries improves device stability. Further, by virtue of the excellent humidity resistance of EA, the film morphologies obtained at high relative humidity (50%) are similar to those obtained under dry conditions, exhibiting an impressive PCE of 20.11%. We believe that our optimized fabrication process using EA can be extended to other green antisolvent systems.",

The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cell reaches 10.38% by using PbI2 with a concentration of 1.0\u202fM and CH3NH3I with a concentration of 0.063\u202fM in ambient atmosphere with a relative humidity of about 40%. The PCE of the device may be further improved by optimizing the density and length of nanorod arrays and using glove box. These results provide valuable information for preparing more efficient all-solid-state PSC based on nanorod arrays.",

In addition, the intermediate structures formed by urea govern the final perovskite morphology through retarding the perovskite crystal growth. Thus, large-grain CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film with almost full surface coverage achieves by the incorporation of urea especially when antisolvent technique is applied during the spin coating.

The effects of thickness variation of ETL on the solar cell parameters have been investigated by solving the drift-diffusion model. The measurements show that the efficiency of the solar cell is decreased with increased ETL thickness which is attributed to higher trap sites in the active layer and ETL.

Here, the PCE degradation resulting from the chromium ions diffusion has been investigated in the inverted structured PSC by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Elemental depth profiles indicate that chromium ions diffuse at CH3NH3PbI3/CrOx interface to change its p-type semiconducting properties with the content alteration of chromium in CrOx film, resulting in the instability of CrOx based device. With copper doping, the formation of CuCrO2 could suppress the diffusion of metal ions and the formation of hexavalent chromium ions and surface hydrate phase CrO(OH)/Cr(OH)3, and then decrease the chance to react with CH3NH3PbI3 (or its degradation product). Consequently, the stability is improved for the Cu:CrOx-based device.

Lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2) precursor, by contrast, was more promising because of the needless of anti-solvent washing during the fabrication of perovskite films. However, the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) needs to be improved. Here, we developed a simple strategy to improve the efficiency of PSCs by adding a small amount of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) into the precursor solution of perovskite. An increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from 13.34% to 15.74% was achieved. It was found that with the addition of DMSO, a stable mesophase structure was formed, which significantly delayed the crystallization of perovskite during the spin-coating of precursor solution, resulting in more uniform and dense perovskite films. The trap intensity and charge carrier mobility of the perovskite films were estimated. The charge carrier dynamic and the recombination in the PSCs were studied. Our method provided a convenient way to improve the performance of PSCs based on Pb(Ac)2 precursor.",

Here, the growth of concentric and colorful periodic ring perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films using a sequential two-step deposition is investigated in detail. The appearance of the ringed perovskite films is mainly tuned by the CH3NH3I solution concentration during the drop coating process. The perovskite films composed of annular areas with different color contrasts, which accounts for the concentric and regular rings. The crystallization-depletion mechanism gives rise to a concentration gradient and a preferential ringed crystallization of the perovskite. The radius and spacing of these rings can be tuned by the substrate temperature and the drop height. Solar cells based on these films still show decent power conversion efficiencies over 17%. These present findings significantly enhance our understanding of the sequential two-step deposition perovskite films and feature the fabrication of special solar cells.",

The resistivity of PEDOT:PSS decreases and then increases as SDDBD treatment time increases. This trend well corresponds to the PEDOT/PSS ratio, as indicated by the change of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) S2p binding energy peak area ratio upon SDDBD treatment. Plasma treatment could eliminate part of excess PSS on the surface to uncover the PEDOT phase and change the PEDOT/PSS ratio, thereby altering the resistivity and work function of PEDOT:PSS.

For inverted architecture cells, spin coated (SC) PEDOT:PSS has been widely implemented as hole transport material, but it has still unresolved issues regarding stability and scalability. In this work we deposited PEDOT:PSS layers by an alternative electrochemical (EC) route that offers precise synthesis control, scale-up potential and enhanced cell stability. The EC-PEDOT:PSS layers were deposited on ITO substrates from an aqueous solution of EDOT and NaPSS by cyclic voltammetry. Additionally, NaCl in different concentrations was added to the synthesis solution to tune the redox state of the polymer, as confirmed by UV-vis measurements. Photoluminescence emission spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite deposited on EC- and SC-PEDOT:PSS layers showed that both had a similar charge collection efficiency. Furthermore, SEM images demonstrated that MAPbI3 grew similarly on both films. Finally, inverted perovskite solar cells were fabricated using these layers. The results showed that 0.1 M NaCl doped EC-PEDOT:PSS performed similarly as the SC-PEDOT:PSS, achieving efficiencies as high as 11% and improved fill factors exceeding 80%. Most importantly, the EC-PEDOT:PSS significantly improved the stability of the cells, allowing the devices to maintain 90% of their average efficiency after 15 days.",

Surface modification of the FTO film involved several challenges, such as control of the blocking layer uniformity, removal of pinholes, and deposition of a dense layer. This strategy allows the suppression of charge recombination at the interface between the FTO substrate and hole conductor. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that the plasma treatment increased the charge transfer resistance between the FTO and hole conductor from 95.1 to 351.1\u03a9, indicating enhanced resistance to the electron back reaction. Analyses of the open-circuit photovoltage decay revealed that modification of the surface of the FTO substrate by plasma treatment increased time constant from 6.44 ms to 13.15 ms. The effect is ascribed to suppression of the electron recombination rate. PSCs based on the newly developed electrode had 39% higher efficiency than reference devices.

Perovskite intermediate phase films are deposited by spin coating in a glove box and then annealed in the glove box or air with different humidity. Different from previous reports, the presence of moisture dramatically deteriorates the film morphology, and too high humidity even retards the formation of the perovskite from its intermediate phase. However, the crystallinity, conductivity and optical properties of the films are greatly improved, which in turn contributes to a much better device performance.

Humidity and annealing temperature have great effect on the morphology of perovskite layer in one step method. It was found that in one step method by increasing the humidity from <10% to ~40% (during spin coating and annealing the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite) morphology of the spin coated layer evolves from mostly ribbon shape with a large number of voids to layers comprising hollow fibers.

        "abstract": "A new antisolvent method was developed to prepare CH3NH3PbI3 and electron transport layers for making efficient hybrid perovskite solar cells. By directly using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester in chlorobenzene solution as antisolvent, CH3NH3PbI3 and electron transport layers were simultaneously formed in the films. This method not only simplifies the fabrication process of devices, but also produces uniform perovskite films and improves the interfacial structures between CH3NH3PbI3 and electron transport layers. Large perovskite grains were observed in these films, with the average grain size of >1\u202f\u03bcm. The so-formed CH3NH3PbI3/electron transport layers demonstrated good optical and charge transport properties. And perovskite solar cells fabricated using these simultaneously-formed layers achieved a higher power conversion efficiency of 16.58% compared to conventional antisolvent method (14.92%). This method reduces nearly 80% usage of chlorobenzene during the fabrication, offering a more facile and environment-friendly approach to fabricate efficient perovskite solar cells than the conventional antisolvent method.",

The preheating of substrate before spin-coating of precursor solution drastically changed the quality of the obtained perovskite films. The perovskite films formed by modified solvent bathing method were much dense with large grains. The improvement of open circuit voltage implied that the modification succeeded to form the better interface between TiO2 and perovskite layer and to grow the higher quality perovskite layer. Finally, we obtained the best conversion efficiency of 12.6%. Although the conversion efficiency of this work is not sufficient compared with other reports, our modified solvent bathing method has a wider process window comparing to the commonly used anti-solvent dipping methods. We expect that our modified method can also applied to monolithic tandem solar cells.",

Herein we report the fabrication of p-type copper sulfide thin films (CuxS) used for the first time as semitransparent electrode used as an example in inverted-planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The resulting hole-transporting-material-free and indium-tin-oxide-free (ITO-free) device showed an unprecedented 5.9% efficiency (PCE). Morphological, structural and optoelectronic analysis of the CuxS films were accomplished to correlate the photovoltaic behavior of the obtained PSCs. In particular, covellite (CuS) and digenite (Cu1.8S) crystal phases were identified in the resulting CuxS film. The p-type CuxS semitransparent electrode exhibited high 1094\u202fS\u202fcm\u22121 electrical conductivity comparable to state-of-the-art transparent conductive electrodes (TCE). Although the CuxS electrode exhibits a relatively low bandgap around 2.7\u202feV, the spectral response of the devices demonstrates that the related optical loss happens just in the blue and UV region of the visible spectrum leading to a reduction of the photocurrent below 10%. On the other hand, surface photovoltage analysis of the grown perovskite indicates that the CuxS electrode induces an optimal band alignment in the perovskite surface while trap states were favored by using CuxS regarding ITO. These results suggest that photovoltaic parameters of CuxS-based PSCs can be still improved by a better control of perovskite growing. Finally, material cost per square meter (US$/m2) was estimated for CuxS electrodes and an impressive reduction of 77.6% was observed compared to commercial ITO. These results highlight the potential application of CuxS film as low-cost, non-toxic and scalable p-type semitransparent electrode in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.",

Highly-crystalline ZnO nanorods were deposited electrochemically which served as the scaffold for spin-coated TiO2 nanoparticles. This ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposite is designed to integrate the fast electron transport along the nanorods and the additional surface area provided by the nanoparticles for enhanced electronic contact between the electron-transporting layer and the perovskite layer. A weak photoluminescence quenching behavior was observed for ZnO nanorods after TiO2 nanoparticle coating which signifies a reduction in ZnO surface defects. Steady-state photoluminescence and optical absorption measurements indicated improved charge transfer and higher absorption of light, respectively, when ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposite is contacted with the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. However, the clustering of the nanoparticles caused inefficient charge transfer from TiO2 to ZnO.",

In this study, we have used four anti-solvents- toluene, chlorobenzene, p-xylene and ether to fabricate high quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. We investigated the surface morphology, optical and structural properties of the corresponding perovskite films. Consequently, PSCs with variation of these anti-solvents were fabricated and the respective photovoltaic performances over a period of 30\u202fdays in dark and under air mass 1.5G sunlight conditions have been observed. Our analyses onto the post fabrication of PSCs highlight that, the perovskite films formed by toluene, chlorobenzene and p-xylene treatment results in high efficient and stable PSCs in dark. Interestingly, the ether treated PSC had no photovoltaic response after 10\u202fdays. The toluene and chlorobenzene treated PSCs showed stable device performance and retained \u0334 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency even after 30\u202fdays light soaking.

The Zn1-xMgxO films were prepared by sol-gel and sputtering methods. It is disclosed that the Zn1-xMgxO buffers with increasing [Mg]/([Mg]\u202f+\u202f[Zn]) from 0 (pure ZnO) to 0.15 prepared by the sol-gel method lead to the enhancement of conversion efficiency (\u03b7) from 10.7 to 15.1%, attributed to the improvement of the CBO. However, the Zn1-xMgxO buffers with enhancing [Mg]/([Mg]\u202f+\u202f[Zn]) from 0 to 0.10 deposited by the sputtering method yield the decrease in \u03b7 from 6.6 to 5.6%. The lower \u03b7 in the case of the sputtering method is mainly caused by the lower short-circuit current density (JSC). According to micro-scale current path distributions of ZnO-coated SnO2:F (FTO) substrates, local current easily flows in case of ZnO-coated FTO sample by sol-gel method. On the other hand, the local current hardly flows especially at peak regions of sample surface in case of ZnO-coated FTO sample by sputtering method. This is because ZnO (or Zn1-xMgxO with [Mg]/([Mg]\u202f+\u202f[Zn]) of 0) by sputtering has higher resistance than that by sol-gel method and tends to be formed on peak regions of the FTO surface. Consequently, the low JSC of the perovskite solar cells with the buffer by sputtering method is observed.",

The optical properties of the solution-processed organic inorganic halide perovskite layers deposited on meso-structured TiO2 scaffolds are investigated using UV\u2013Vis reflectance and transmittance spectroscopies at the wavelength range of 400\u2013900\u202fnm. Optical parameters including refractive index, extinction coefficient, real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constants, optical conductivity and direct and indirect optical band gaps are calculated and compared for the perovskite films created by above mentioned methods. Optical band gaps are determined from the absorption coefficient values using Tauc's power law. The obtained values of direct band gap for two perovskite films are close to each other (1.56 and 1.58\u202feV for perovskite layer deposited by OSM and HCT respectively). For both prepared films, the difference between direct and indirect band gaps is 60\u202fmeV which is in very good agreement with that reported in literature. In addition to the difference between the perovskite morphology, the optical absorption of perovskite layers created by the HCT is less than that of layers prepared by OSM and therefore the amount of generated photo current is less. This is the main reason that causes the efficiency of perovskite solar cells prepared by HCT (3.0%) is ~38% less than that of cells created by OSM (4.15%).",

To better introduce this route to the perovskite solar cell field and produce well-performance hole transport layers (HTLs) of NiO NCs, we got inspired by ligand-protecting strategy. The stability of NiO NCs in reaction system is improved significantly, and the nucleation and growth of NiO NCs can be controlled effectively, which makes for the high crystallinity. Furthermore, the extraordinary dispersion of NiO NCs in chlorobenzene solvent can be observed, which makes the preparation of HTL films by simple spin-coating method possible. The relevant measurements and analysis manifest that the HTLs of NiO NCs with excellent transparency, good film-forming performance, admirable hole transport capability and few interface traps can be obtained by optimizing the concentration of NiO NCs, finally contributing to the photovoltaic performance of corresponding inverted planar PSCs.
