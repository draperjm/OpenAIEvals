{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If a mother had one daughter named May, which was born in May, another named Summer which was born in the summer, another named Autumn, and a daughter named October which was born in November, which daughter was born during Autumn?"}], "ideal": "Because November is a month during Autumn, with the daughter October being born in November, October is the daughter which was born during Autumn. Though one daughter’s name is Autumn, it is not explicitly stated that she was born during Autumn, and one can only be sure that October was born during Autumn due to the certainty that November is a month during Autumn. Half of the mother’s daughters were named after the month in which they were born, with one being named after a season, with the month or season in which she was born being unknown (not specified), and another being named after a month, not the one in which she was born."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You see a sinking boat with 6 life rafts on its sides (3 on each side), with each life raft being able to accommodate up to 20 people. If one side of the boat became submerged due to its sinking, with all of the life rafts on that one side becoming unusable, at most how many passengers on the boat could be rescued with the remaining life rafts?"}], "ideal": "Given that each life raft can accommodate up to 20 people, 6 life rafts collectively could accommodate up to 120 people. However, with half of the original six life rafts available, up to 60 of the ships passengers could be rescued by the remaining three life rafts."}

The two doors and their respective keys merely swapped colors, and as such everything should still work, of course as a different color."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "If you had a bathtub full of water, a cup, and a shot glass with the capacity of a cup, which would take more scoops to remove all of the water from the bath tub?"}], "ideal": "Being that the cup, and the shot glass with the capacity of a cup, both have the same volume, removing all of the water from the bath tub with either the shot glass with the capacity of a cup, or the cup, would both take an equal number of scoops."}
